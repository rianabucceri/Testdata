Question 97 asks about the types of audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). There are three basic types of audits: 
• Financial audits are intended to determine if an entity’s financial information is accurate (free from errors or fraud) and presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting and regulatory framework. See ISSAI 200 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai100-fundamental-principles-of-public-sector-auditing/) for more detail. 
• Compliance audits look at the extent to which the relevant regulations and procedures have been followed. See ISSAI 400 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-400-compliance-audit-principles/) for more details. 
• Performance audits assess whether activities are adhering to the principles of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. See ISSAI 300 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-300-performance-audit-principles/) for more details. 

Financial and compliance audits are more common than performance audits, which usually occur only once a performance framework has been agreed upon. In some countries, the SAI’s mandate limits the type of audit it can conduct. 

To answer “a,” the SAI must have conducted all three types of audit — financial, compliance, and performance — and made all of them available to the public. A “b” response applies if the SAI has conducted two of the three audit types, and a “c” applies if it has conducted only one type of audit. Answers “b” and “c” may be selected even if the Audit Report is not publicly available, as long as the SAI has conducted compliance or performance audits and made them available to the public. A “d” response applies if the SAI has not conducted any of the three types of audits, or has not made them available to the public.

A “b” response applies if the SAI has conducted two of the three audit types, and a “c” applies if it has conducted only one type of audit. Answers “b” and “c” may be selected even if the Audit Report is not publicly available, as long as the SAI has conducted compliance or performance audits and made them available to the public. A “d” response applies if the SAI has not conducted any of the three types of audits, or has not made them available to the public.

Question 97 asks about the types of audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). There are three basic types of audits: 
• Financial audits are intended to determine if an entity’s financial information is accurate (free from errors or fraud) and presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting and regulatory framework. See ISSAI 200 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai100-fundamental-principles-of-public-sector-auditing/) for more detail. 
• Compliance audits look at the extent to which the relevant regulations and procedures have been followed. See ISSAI 400 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-400-compliance-audit-principles/) for more details. 
• Performance audits assess whether activities are adhering to the principles of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. See ISSAI 300 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-300-performance-audit-principles/) for more details.

See ISSAI 200 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai100-fundamental-principles-of-public-sector-auditing/) for more detail. 
• Compliance audits look at the extent to which the relevant regulations and procedures have been followed. See ISSAI 400 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-400-compliance-audit-principles/) for more details. 
• Performance audits assess whether activities are adhering to the principles of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. See ISSAI 300 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-300-performance-audit-principles/) for more details. 

Financial and compliance audits are more common than performance audits, which usually occur only once a performance framework has been agreed upon. In some countries, the SAI’s mandate limits the type of audit it can conduct. 

To answer “a,” the SAI must have conducted all three types of audit — financial, compliance, and performance — and made all of them available to the public. A “b” response applies if the SAI has conducted two of the three audit types, and a “c” applies if it has conducted only one type of audit. Answers “b” and “c” may be selected even if the Audit Report is not publicly available, as long as the SAI has conducted compliance or performance audits and made them available to the public. A “d” response applies if the SAI has not conducted any of the three types of audits, or has not made them available to the public.

Question 97 asks about the types of audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). There are three basic types of audits: 
• Financial audits are intended to determine if an entity’s financial information is accurate (free from errors or fraud) and presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting and regulatory framework. See ISSAI 200 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai100-fundamental-principles-of-public-sector-auditing/) for more detail. 
• Compliance audits look at the extent to which the relevant regulations and procedures have been followed. See ISSAI 400 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-400-compliance-audit-principles/) for more details. 
• Performance audits assess whether activities are adhering to the principles of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. See ISSAI 300 (https://www.issai.org/pronouncements/issai-300-performance-audit-principles/) for more details. 

Financial and compliance audits are more common than performance audits, which usually occur only once a performance framework has been agreed upon. In some countries, the SAI’s mandate limits the type of audit it can conduct. 

To answer “a,” the SAI must have conducted all three types of audit — financial, compliance, and performance — and made all of them available to the public. A “b” response applies if the SAI has conducted two of the three audit types, and a “c” applies if it has conducted only one type of audit. Answers “b” and “c” may be selected even if the Audit Report is not publicly available, as long as the SAI has conducted compliance or performance audits and made them available to the public. A “d” response applies if the SAI has not conducted any of the three types of audits, or has not made them available to the public.

Question 112 assesses the role of a specialized budget or finance committee during the budget approval stage. Effective committee involvement is an essential condition for legislative influence in the budget process. Specialized committees provide opportunities for individual legislators to gain relevant expertise, and to examine budgets and policy in depth. Yet, the involvement of committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures have separate committees to examine spending and tax proposals, while others have a single finance committee. Not all legislatures have a specialized budget or finance committee to examine the budget. In addition, there can be differences in the time available for the committee’s analysis of the budget. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, therefore it must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. 

Response “a” requires that, in the last budget approval process, a specialized budget or finance committee had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and it published a report with findings and recommendations prior to the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such a committee examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month.

Question 112 assesses the role of a specialized budget or finance committee during the budget approval stage. Effective committee involvement is an essential condition for legislative influence in the budget process. Specialized committees provide opportunities for individual legislators to gain relevant expertise, and to examine budgets and policy in depth. Yet, the involvement of committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures have separate committees to examine spending and tax proposals, while others have a single finance committee. Not all legislatures have a specialized budget or finance committee to examine the budget. In addition, there can be differences in the time available for the committee’s analysis of the budget. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, therefore it must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. 

Response “a” requires that, in the last budget approval process, a specialized budget or finance committee had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and it published a report with findings and recommendations prior to the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such a committee examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” 127 applies if a committee examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where a specialized budget or finance committee did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal. 

Please specify in your comment the name of the committee and the number of days it had available to examine the budget. For bicameral legislatures where one house or chamber has greater constitutional authority in budgetary matters, the question applies to the house or chamber (usually the upper or second one) that is decisive.

Question 112 assesses the role of a specialized budget or finance committee during the budget approval stage. Effective committee involvement is an essential condition for legislative influence in the budget process. Specialized committees provide opportunities for individual legislators to gain relevant expertise, and to examine budgets and policy in depth. Yet, the involvement of committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures have separate committees to examine spending and tax proposals, while others have a single finance committee. Not all legislatures have a specialized budget or finance committee to examine the budget. In addition, there can be differences in the time available for the committee’s analysis of the budget. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, therefore it must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. 

Response “a” requires that, in the last budget approval process, a specialized budget or finance committee had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and it published a report with findings and recommendations prior to the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such a committee examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” 127 applies if a committee examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where a specialized budget or finance committee did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal. 

Please specify in your comment the name of the committee and the number of days it had available to examine the budget. For bicameral legislatures where one house or chamber has greater constitutional authority in budgetary matters, the question applies to the house or chamber (usually the upper or second one) that is decisive. For bicameral legislatures with co-equal houses or chambers, the question should be answered with reference to the one that achieves the higher score for this question. In the case of bicameral legislatures, please note the relevant arrangements in each house or chamber. If applicable, provide a copy of the report.

Question 112 assesses the role of a specialized budget or finance committee during the budget approval stage. Effective committee involvement is an essential condition for legislative influence in the budget process. Specialized committees provide opportunities for individual legislators to gain relevant expertise, and to examine budgets and policy in depth. Yet, the involvement of committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures have separate committees to examine spending and tax proposals, while others have a single finance committee. Not all legislatures have a specialized budget or finance committee to examine the budget. In addition, there can be differences in the time available for the committee’s analysis of the budget. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, therefore it must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. 

Response “a” requires that, in the last budget approval process, a specialized budget or finance committee had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and it published a report with findings and recommendations prior to the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such a committee examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” 127 applies if a committee examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where a specialized budget or finance committee did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal. 

Please specify in your comment the name of the committee and the number of days it had available to examine the budget. For bicameral legislatures where one house or chamber has greater constitutional authority in budgetary matters, the question applies to the house or chamber (usually the upper or second one) that is decisive. For bicameral legislatures with co-equal houses or chambers, the question should be answered with reference to the one that achieves the higher score for this question. In the case of bicameral legislatures, please note the relevant arrangements in each house or chamber. If applicable, provide a copy of the report.

Question 112 assesses the role of a specialized budget or finance committee during the budget approval stage. Effective committee involvement is an essential condition for legislative influence in the budget process. Specialized committees provide opportunities for individual legislators to gain relevant expertise, and to examine budgets and policy in depth. Yet, the involvement of committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures have separate committees to examine spending and tax proposals, while others have a single finance committee. Not all legislatures have a specialized budget or finance committee to examine the budget. In addition, there can be differences in the time available for the committee’s analysis of the budget. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, therefore it must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. 

Response “a” requires that, in the last budget approval process, a specialized budget or finance committee had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and it published a report with findings and recommendations prior to the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such a committee examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” 127 applies if a committee examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where a specialized budget or finance committee did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal. 

Please specify in your comment the name of the committee and the number of days it had available to examine the budget. For bicameral legislatures where one house or chamber has greater constitutional authority in budgetary matters, the question applies to the house or chamber (usually the upper or second one) that is decisive. For bicameral legislatures with co-equal houses or chambers, the question should be answered with reference to the one that achieves the higher score for this question. In the case of bicameral legislatures, please note the relevant arrangements in each house or chamber. If applicable, provide a copy of the report. Please note also if a report is published, but only after the budget has been adopted."

Question 112 assesses the role of a specialized budget or finance committee during the budget approval stage. Effective committee involvement is an essential condition for legislative influence in the budget process. Specialized committees provide opportunities for individual legislators to gain relevant expertise, and to examine budgets and policy in depth. Yet, the involvement of committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures have separate committees to examine spending and tax proposals, while others have a single finance committee. Not all legislatures have a specialized budget or finance committee to examine the budget. In addition, there can be differences in the time available for the committee’s analysis of the budget. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, therefore it must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. 

Response “a” requires that, in the last budget approval process, a specialized budget or finance committee had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and it published a report with findings and recommendations prior to the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such a committee examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” 127 applies if a committee examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where a specialized budget or finance committee did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal. 

Please specify in your comment the name of the committee and the number of days it had available to examine the budget. For bicameral legislatures where one house or chamber has greater constitutional authority in budgetary matters, the question applies to the house or chamber (usually the upper or second one) that is decisive. For bicameral legislatures with co-equal houses or chambers, the question should be answered with reference to the one that achieves the higher score for this question.

The role of sectoral committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures do not involve them in the budget approval process, while others do. In addition, the time available for committee analysis differs. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, so therefore must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. Response “a” requires that sector committees had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and published a report with findings and recommendations prior the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such committees examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” applies if sectoral committees examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where sectoral committees did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal. 

Please note that the examination of sectoral budgets by a specialized budget or finance committee is assessed in Question 112 and should not be considered for this question.

Please provide in the comments a brief overview of the committee structure and specify the number of days that sectoral committees had available to examine the budget and to publish their reports. For bicameral legislatures where one house or chamber has greater constitutional authority in budgetary matters, the question applies to the house or chamber (usually the upper or second one) that is decisive.

Question 113 assesses the role of committees of the legislature that are responsible for particular sectors (e.g., health, education, defense, etc.) during the budget approval stage. The role of sectoral committees differs across legislatures. Some legislatures do not involve them in the budget approval process, while others do. In addition, the time available for committee analysis differs. 

A report with the committee’s findings and recommendations is intended to inform the debate in the full legislature, so therefore must be published before the legislature has adopted the budget. Response “a” requires that sector committees had one month or more to examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal, and published a report with findings and recommendations prior the budget being adopted. Response “b” applies where such committees examined the draft budget and published a report, but within a shorter timeframe of less than one month. Response “c” applies if sectoral committees examined the budget (without regard to the time period), but did not publish a report prior to the adoption of the budget. Response “d” applies where sectoral committees did not examine the Executive’s Budget Proposal.

Question 114 is about legislative oversight of budget execution. It assesses whether and how often a committee examined the implementation of the budget during the budget execution period (i.e., financial year) for which it was approved, and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. This question does not apply to the ex post review of implementation following the end of the budget year as part of the audit stage, which is assessed separately. Nor does it apply to the legislature’s review of the budget that it may undertake as part of the process of considering a supplemental budget during the year. In-year monitoring by the legislature will be affected by the frequency that the executive publishes In-Year Reports. 

To answer “a,” a committee must have examined in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget at least three times during the course of the relevant budget year and published reports with findings and recommendations. Answer “b” applies where this occurred only once or twice during the year. Exception: If a legislature is in session only twice during the year, and it examines the implementation of the budget during both sessions, then it would be eligible for an “a” response.

Nor does it apply to the legislature’s review of the budget that it may undertake as part of the process of considering a supplemental budget during the year. In-year monitoring by the legislature will be affected by the frequency that the executive publishes In-Year Reports. 

To answer “a,” a committee must have examined in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget at least three times during the course of the relevant budget year and published reports with findings and recommendations. Answer “b” applies where this occurred only once or twice during the year. Exception: If a legislature is in session only twice during the year, and it examines the implementation of the budget during both sessions, then it would be eligible for an “a” response. 

Choose “c” if a committee examined in-year implementation (without regard to frequency), but did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined in-year implementation. 

If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation, and provide a copy of its report(s). If the answer is “c,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation. 

For purposes of responding to this question, if more than one committee holds in-year reviews of the budget, use the committee that is best performing – that is, the one that examines in-year implementation the most times and that publishes a report."

Question 114 is about legislative oversight of budget execution. It assesses whether and how often a committee examined the implementation of the budget during the budget execution period (i.e., financial year) for which it was approved, and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. This question does not apply to the ex post review of implementation following the end of the budget year as part of the audit stage, which is assessed separately. Nor does it apply to the legislature’s review of the budget that it may undertake as part of the process of considering a supplemental budget during the year. In-year monitoring by the legislature will be affected by the frequency that the executive publishes In-Year Reports. 

To answer “a,” a committee must have examined in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget at least three times during the course of the relevant budget year and published reports with findings and recommendations. Answer “b” applies where this occurred only once or twice during the year. Exception: If a legislature is in session only twice during the year, and it examines the implementation of the budget during both sessions, then it would be eligible for an “a” response.

Question 114 is about legislative oversight of budget execution. It assesses whether and how often a committee examined the implementation of the budget during the budget execution period (i.e., financial year) for which it was approved, and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. This question does not apply to the ex post review of implementation following the end of the budget year as part of the audit stage, which is assessed separately. Nor does it apply to the legislature’s review of the budget that it may undertake as part of the process of considering a supplemental budget during the year. In-year monitoring by the legislature will be affected by the frequency that the executive publishes In-Year Reports. 

To answer “a,” a committee must have examined in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget at least three times during the course of the relevant budget year and published reports with findings and recommendations. Answer “b” applies where this occurred only once or twice during the year. Exception: If a legislature is in session only twice during the year, and it examines the implementation of the budget during both sessions, then it would be eligible for an “a” response. 

Choose “c” if a committee examined in-year implementation (without regard to frequency), but did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined in-year implementation. 

If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation, and provide a copy of its report(s). If the answer is “c,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation.

Nor does it apply to the legislature’s review of the budget that it may undertake as part of the process of considering a supplemental budget during the year. In-year monitoring by the legislature will be affected by the frequency that the executive publishes In-Year Reports. 

To answer “a,” a committee must have examined in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget at least three times during the course of the relevant budget year and published reports with findings and recommendations. Answer “b” applies where this occurred only once or twice during the year. Exception: If a legislature is in session only twice during the year, and it examines the implementation of the budget during both sessions, then it would be eligible for an “a” response. 

Choose “c” if a committee examined in-year implementation (without regard to frequency), but did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined in-year implementation. 

If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation, and provide a copy of its report(s). If the answer is “c,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation. 

For purposes of responding to this question, if more than one committee holds in-year reviews of the budget, use the committee that is best performing – that is, the one that examines in-year implementation the most times and that publishes a report."

Question 114 is about legislative oversight of budget execution. It assesses whether and how often a committee examined the implementation of the budget during the budget execution period (i.e., financial year) for which it was approved, and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. This question does not apply to the ex post review of implementation following the end of the budget year as part of the audit stage, which is assessed separately. Nor does it apply to the legislature’s review of the budget that it may undertake as part of the process of considering a supplemental budget during the year. In-year monitoring by the legislature will be affected by the frequency that the executive publishes In-Year Reports. 

To answer “a,” a committee must have examined in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget at least three times during the course of the relevant budget year and published reports with findings and recommendations. Answer “b” applies where this occurred only once or twice during the year. Exception: If a legislature is in session only twice during the year, and it examines the implementation of the budget during both sessions, then it would be eligible for an “a” response. 

Choose “c” if a committee examined in-year implementation (without regard to frequency), but did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined in-year implementation. 

If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation, and provide a copy of its report(s). If the answer is “c,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation.

Question 118 is about ex post oversight following the implementation of the budget. It probes whether a committee examined the Audit Report on the annual budget produced by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. A key issue is how soon after the SAI releases the report does it legislature review it. This question does not apply to the legislative scrutiny of in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget during the relevant budget execution period, which is assessed separately. Also, the question is asking specifically about the SAI’s annual report on the execution of the budget, not about other audit reports that the SAI may produce. (This is the Audit Report used for responding to Question 98.) 

To answer “a,” a legislative committee must have examined the annual Audit Report within three months of it being released by the SAI, and then published a report (or reports) with findings and recommendations. (Note that the three-month period should only take into account time when the legislature is in session.) 

Answer “b” applies when the committee examines it within six months of it being released (but more than three months), and then published a report with its findings and recommendations. Choose “c” if a committee examined the annual Audit Report more than six months after it became available or it did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined the annual Audit Report.

It probes whether a committee examined the Audit Report on the annual budget produced by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. A key issue is how soon after the SAI releases the report does it legislature review it. This question does not apply to the legislative scrutiny of in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget during the relevant budget execution period, which is assessed separately. Also, the question is asking specifically about the SAI’s annual report on the execution of the budget, not about other audit reports that the SAI may produce. (This is the Audit Report used for responding to Question 98.) 

To answer “a,” a legislative committee must have examined the annual Audit Report within three months of it being released by the SAI, and then published a report (or reports) with findings and recommendations. (Note that the three-month period should only take into account time when the legislature is in session.) 

Answer “b” applies when the committee examines it within six months of it being released (but more than three months), and then published a report with its findings and recommendations. Choose “c” if a committee examined the annual Audit Report more than six months after it became available or it did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined the annual Audit Report. If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed the Audit Report, and provide a copy of its report(s). 

If the answer is “c,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation. Answers “a,” “b,” or “c” may be selected if the Audit Report is produced by the SAI but not made publicly available.

Question 118 is about ex post oversight following the implementation of the budget. It probes whether a committee examined the Audit Report on the annual budget produced by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. A key issue is how soon after the SAI releases the report does it legislature review it. This question does not apply to the legislative scrutiny of in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget during the relevant budget execution period, which is assessed separately. Also, the question is asking specifically about the SAI’s annual report on the execution of the budget, not about other audit reports that the SAI may produce. (This is the Audit Report used for responding to Question 98.) 

To answer “a,” a legislative committee must have examined the annual Audit Report within three months of it being released by the SAI, and then published a report (or reports) with findings and recommendations. (Note that the three-month period should only take into account time when the legislature is in session.) 

Answer “b” applies when the committee examines it within six months of it being released (but more than three months), and then published a report with its findings and recommendations. Choose “c” if a committee examined the annual Audit Report more than six months after it became available or it did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined the annual Audit Report. If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed the Audit Report, and provide a copy of its report(s).

This question does not apply to the legislative scrutiny of in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget during the relevant budget execution period, which is assessed separately. Also, the question is asking specifically about the SAI’s annual report on the execution of the budget, not about other audit reports that the SAI may produce. (This is the Audit Report used for responding to Question 98.) 

To answer “a,” a legislative committee must have examined the annual Audit Report within three months of it being released by the SAI, and then published a report (or reports) with findings and recommendations. (Note that the three-month period should only take into account time when the legislature is in session.) 

Answer “b” applies when the committee examines it within six months of it being released (but more than three months), and then published a report with its findings and recommendations. Choose “c” if a committee examined the annual Audit Report more than six months after it became available or it did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined the annual Audit Report. If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed the Audit Report, and provide a copy of its report(s). 

If the answer is “c,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed budget implementation. Answers “a,” “b,” or “c” may be selected if the Audit Report is produced by the SAI but not made publicly available.

For OGP purposes, a score of a) or b) is considered “Yes”. A score of c) or d) is considered “No”. See how the OBS determines scores below.

Question 118 is about ex post oversight following the implementation of the budget. It probes whether a committee examined the Audit Report on the annual budget produced by the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), and whether this resulted in an official report with findings and recommendations. A key issue is how soon after the SAI releases the report does it legislature review it. This question does not apply to the legislative scrutiny of in-year implementation of the Enacted Budget during the relevant budget execution period, which is assessed separately. Also, the question is asking specifically about the SAI’s annual report on the execution of the budget, not about other audit reports that the SAI may produce. (This is the Audit Report used for responding to Question 98.) 

To answer “a,” a legislative committee must have examined the annual Audit Report within three months of it being released by the SAI, and then published a report (or reports) with findings and recommendations. (Note that the three-month period should only take into account time when the legislature is in session.) 

Answer “b” applies when the committee examines it within six months of it being released (but more than three months), and then published a report with its findings and recommendations. Choose “c” if a committee examined the annual Audit Report more than six months after it became available or it did not publish any report with findings and recommendations. Answer “d” applies where no committee examined the annual Audit Report. If the answer is “a” or “b,” please specify the name of the committee and when it reviewed the Audit Report, and provide a copy of its report(s).

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive. 

The drafting of this question and its answers are partially drawn from the IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation, in particular with regards to the concepts of “involvement” (option “a” in the responses) and “consultation” (option “b”). See: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.iap2.org/resource/resmgr/foundations_course/IAP2_P2_Spectrum_FINAL.pdf. 

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record. 

The researcher must present evidence to support selection of a “c” response.

Answer “d” applies if the requirements for a “c” response or above are not met or if the executive does not use public participation mechanisms during the budget formulation stage."

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations).

While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs.

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

The drafting of this question and its answers are partially drawn from the IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation, in particular with regards to the concepts of “involvement” (option “a” in the responses) and “consultation” (option “b”).

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record. 

The researcher must present evidence to support selection of a “c” response.

Answer “d” applies if the requirements for a “c” response or above are not met or if the executive does not use public participation mechanisms during the budget formulation stage."

The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record. 

The researcher must present evidence to support selection of a “c” response.

Answer “d” applies if the requirements for a “c” response or above are not met or if the executive does not use public participation mechanisms during the budget formulation stage."

This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to participate in the budget formulation phase, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured and happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or 

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, there should be some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and individual members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples of mechanisms that might qualify as a “c” response include hotlines, Facebook announcements, and one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record. 

The researcher must present evidence to support selection of a “c” response.

Answer “d” applies if the requirements for a “c” response or above are not met or if the executive does not use public participation mechanisms during the budget formulation stage."

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in the formulation of the annual budget, including annual pre-budget discussions. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as spending and tax policy, funding and revenue levels, and macro-fiscal planning. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the formulation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government officials. Examples include public meetings and online deliberative exchanges. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input in the formulation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include surveys, focus groups, report cards, published policy consultation exercises, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

The drafting of this question and its answers are partially drawn from the IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation, in particular with regards to the concepts of “involvement” (option “a” in the responses) and “consultation” (option “b”). See: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.iap2.org/resource/resmgr/foundations_course/IAP2_P2_Spectrum_FINAL.pdf.  

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but:

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or
2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations).

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but:

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, the researcher must have evidence that the government is holding participation mechanisms that have some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples include hotlines, Facebook announcements, one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or

While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, the researcher must have evidence that the government is holding participation mechanisms that have some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples include hotlines, Facebook announcements, one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or

While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, the researcher must have evidence that the government is holding participation mechanisms that have some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples include hotlines, Facebook announcements, one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or

While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, the researcher must have evidence that the government is holding participation mechanisms that have some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples include hotlines, Facebook announcements, one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or

While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, the researcher must have evidence that the government is holding participation mechanisms that have some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples include hotlines, Facebook announcements, one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but: 

1) The mechanisms are not structured, happen only on ad-hoc basis, or not regularly. and/or

2) The executive consults with and/or interacts with, citizens, but there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, and the executive determines fully or partially such selection process by inviting specific groups (for example by making an open call but just to experts from a particular sector, or naming specific organizations). While it is not possible for all citizens and/or CSOs to participate in this or other phases of the budget process, options “a” and “b” apply if the government does not exercise any discretion in determining who is allowed to participate. While there is likely going to be self-selection, it is important that the selection is not made by the executive. 

In cases where there is discretion in who is allowed to participate, to select answer choice “c”, the researcher must have evidence that the government is holding participation mechanisms that have some sort of public record (held in public, minutes of meetings released to public) so that all CSOs and members of the public can have knowledge of the meeting, who participated, and what was discussed. 

Examples include hotlines, Facebook announcements, one-off meetings with NGOs in which there is a public record.

This question reflects the GIFT principles on “Inclusiveness” and “Timeliness” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the executive are truly interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the executive.

Please consider only participation mechanisms that the Ministry of Finance, lead budget agency, or central coordinating agency designated by the government to implement participation mechanisms (“the executive”) is currently using to allow the public to participate in monitoring the implementation of the annual budget. If the executive has designated a central coordinating agency to implement participation mechanisms throughout the national budget process, researchers may consider these mechanisms. Participation mechanisms used only by line ministries should not be used to answer this question. If there is more than one mechanism used by the executive, please select the deepest or most interactive mechanism that reflects the government’s efforts to incorporate citizens’ input into the implementation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenue administration, public service delivery, public investment project implementation, including procurement, and the administration of social transfer schemes. 

To answer “a,” the executive must use open participation mechanisms that involve the public in the implementation of the annual budget. This means that a public process is in place whereby CSOs and/or individual members of the public and government officials interact, and have the opportunity to express their opinions to each other in what can be considered a public dialogue between them (i.e., in-person and online discussion forums). Additionally, the mechanism should be open to any CSO and/or individual members of the public who wish to participate. By selecting this answer, the researcher must present evidence to support the presence of a public dialogue among citizens and government official. Examples include public meetings, online, deliberative exchanges, procurement complaint mechanisms, and social monitoring and dialogue. 

Answer “b” applies if an open consultation mechanism is in place whereby members of the public (i.e., individuals and/or CSOs as well as academics, independent experts, policy think tanks, and business organizations) can provide their input on the implementation of the annual budget. This answer applies if the government is using a mechanism that is structured and well established, and not ad-hoc. The researcher must present evidence to support the presence of consultative processes through which the executive seeks out inputs from citizens. Examples include public hearings, surveys, focus groups, report cards, and online platforms that government officials actively manage to solicit inputs. 

Answer “c” applies if the executive has established a mechanism or mechanisms to allow citizens to provide input on budget implementation, but:

To answer “a,” the legislature must hold public hearings where citizens are allowed to testify. This answer applies only if the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can testify (for example, participation takes place on a first-come-first-served basis).

Answer “b” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; but 
• There are other means used by the legislature to receive and collect views from citizens and CSOs on the budget, and the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can provide input. The researcher must provide evidence to support the presence of those alternative processes through which the legislature seeks inputs from citizens. For example, there should be a public record indicating that views from citizens and the public were sought. 

Answer “c” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; 
• No other means are used by the legislature to receive and collect views/input from citizens and CSOs on the budget, but 
• The legislature invites a few individuals/groups to provide input (through public hearings or elsewhere).
• The legislature has a provision (via standing orders or in law) through which the public can submit their inputs, and members of the public or CSOs actively use it to submit opinions on the budget.

The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenues, policy selection, and macro-fiscal planning (please note that the issue of coverage is covered in a subsequent question). 

To answer “a,” the legislature must hold public hearings where citizens are allowed to testify. This answer applies only if the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can testify (for example, participation takes place on a first-come-first-served basis).

Answer “b” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; but 
• There are other means used by the legislature to receive and collect views from citizens and CSOs on the budget, and the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can provide input. The researcher must provide evidence to support the presence of those alternative processes through which the legislature seeks inputs from citizens. For example, there should be a public record indicating that views from citizens and the public were sought. 

Answer “c” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; 
• No other means are used by the legislature to receive and collect views/input from citizens and CSOs on the budget, but 
• The legislature invites a few individuals/groups to provide input (through public hearings or elsewhere).
• The legislature has a provision (via standing orders or in law) through which the public can submit their inputs, and members of the public or CSOs actively use it to submit opinions on the budget.

Answer “d” applies if the requirements for a “c” response or above are not met or if the legislature does not use public participation mechanisms during its deliberations on the annual budget."

This answer applies only if the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can testify (for example, participation takes place on a first-come-first-served basis).

Answer “b” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; but 
• There are other means used by the legislature to receive and collect views from citizens and CSOs on the budget, and the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can provide input. The researcher must provide evidence to support the presence of those alternative processes through which the legislature seeks inputs from citizens. For example, there should be a public record indicating that views from citizens and the public were sought. 

Answer “c” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; 
• No other means are used by the legislature to receive and collect views/input from citizens and CSOs on the budget, but 
• The legislature invites a few individuals/groups to provide input (through public hearings or elsewhere).
• The legislature has a provision (via standing orders or in law) through which the public can submit their inputs, and members of the public or CSOs actively use it to submit opinions on the budget.

This question reflects the GIFT principle on “Sustainability,” “Transparency,” and “Complementarity” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the legislative are interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the legislature, rather than being limited to allowing the public to attend or hear public budget deliberations. 

Please consider participation mechanisms that the legislature (both in its whole institution or its relevant budget/public accounts/finance committees) has put in place and is using to allow the public to participate in their deliberations on the annual budget. This includes deliberations during the pre-budget phase (i.e., when the executive is still in the process of formulating the draft budget) and the budget discussions after the budget has been tabled to parliament and before it is approved. In the comment box, please specify during which stage of the budget cycle the legislature has put in place a public participation mechanism. 

Mechanisms through which members of the public reach out to individual Members of Parliament as opposed to the legislature (both in its whole institution or its relevant budget/public accounts/finance committees) or unofficial hearings organized by a subset of committee members should not be considered in answering this question. 

If there is more than one mechanism, please select a mechanism that best shows/reflects the legislature’s efforts to incorporate citizens into the formulation of the annual budget. The participation mechanisms can involve a range of different issues, such as revenues, policy selection, and macro-fiscal planning (please note that the issue of coverage is covered in a subsequent question). 

To answer “a,” the legislature must hold public hearings where citizens are allowed to testify. This answer applies only if the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can testify (for example, participation takes place on a first-come-first-served basis).

Answer “b” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; but 
• There are other means used by the legislature to receive and collect views from citizens and CSOs on the budget, and the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can provide input. The researcher must provide evidence to support the presence of those alternative processes through which the legislature seeks inputs from citizens. For example, there should be a public record indicating that views from citizens and the public were sought. 

Answer “c” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the budget; 
• Testimony is not allowed from members of the public or CSOs; 
• No other means are used by the legislature to receive and collect views/input from citizens and CSOs on the budget, but 
• The legislature invites a few individuals/groups to provide input (through public hearings or elsewhere).

This question reflects the GIFT principle on “Sustainability,” “Transparency,” and “Complementarity” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the legislative are interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the legislature, rather than being limited to allowing the public to attend or hear public budget deliberations. 

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature. 

Please note that by “Audit Report” we refer to the same audit report assessed in the transparency section of this Survey, i.e., one of the eight key budget documents that all governments (in this case, the Supreme Audit Institution) must produce, according to best practice. 

Please consider participation mechanisms that the legislature (both in its whole institution or its relevant budget/public accounts/finance committees) have put in place and using to allow the public to participate in their deliberations on the Audit Report.

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature.

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature.

This question reflects the GIFT principle on “Sustainability,” “Transparency,” and “Complementarity” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the legislative are interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the legislature, rather than being limited to allowing the public to attend or hear public budget deliberations. 

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature.

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature.

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources.

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature.

This question reflects the GIFT principle on “Sustainability,” “Transparency,” and “Complementarity” and assesses the extent to which the participation mechanism(s) used by the legislative are interactive and involve a two-way conversation between citizens and the legislature, rather than being limited to allowing the public to attend or hear public budget deliberations. 

A key constitutional role of the legislature in almost all countries is to oversee the government’s management of public resources. While the Supreme Audit Institution is responsible for checking the government’s accounts and publishing the outcome of their audits, for accountability purposes it is essential that the legislature reviews and scrutinizes those reports, and checks on whether the executive is taking the appropriate corrective actions based on the Supreme Audit Institution’s recommendations. 

Holding public hearings to review audit findings allows the public to learn more about how the government has managed its resources for the budget years that have ended, and demand accountability in case of mismanagement and irregularities. Reviewing and discussing those reports in public is therefore a key responsibility of a legislature. 

Please note that by “Audit Report” we refer to the same audit report assessed in the transparency section of this Survey, i.e., one of the eight key budget documents that all governments (in this case, the Supreme Audit Institution) must produce, according to best practice. 

Please consider participation mechanisms that the legislature (both in its whole institution or its relevant budget/public accounts/finance committees) have put in place and using to allow the public to participate in their deliberations on the Audit Report.

Mechanisms through which members of the public reach out to individual members of parliament as opposed to the legislature (both in its whole institution or its relevant budget/public accounts/finance committees) or unofficial hearings organized by a subset of committee members should not be considered in answering this question. 

To answer “a,” the national legislature must hold public hearings where citizens are allowed to testify. This answer applies only if the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can testify (for example, participation takes place on a first-come-first-served basis). 

Answer “b” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the Audit Report; 
• No testimony is allowed from the public; BUT 
• There are other means used by the legislature to receive and collect views from citizens and CSOs on the Audit Report, and the legislature does not exercise discretion in determining which citizens and/or CSOs can provide input. The researcher must provide evidence to support the presence of those alternative processes through which the legislature seeks inputs from citizens. For example, there should be a public record indicating that views from citizens and the public were sought. 

Answer “c” should be selected if the following applies: 
• The legislature holds public hearings on the Audit Report; 
• No testimony is allowed from the public; 
• No other means are used by the legislature to receive and collect views/input from citizens and CSOs on the Audit Report, BUT 
• The legislature invites a few individuals/groups to provide input (through public hearings or elsewhere) 

Answer “d” applies if the requirements for a “c” response or above are not met or if the legislature does not use public participation mechanisms during its deliberations on the Audit Report."
