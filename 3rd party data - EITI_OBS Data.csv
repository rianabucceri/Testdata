For mining, the 2019 EITI Report states that all licensing activity is undertaken at the subnational level and regulated by Provincial Governments. The MSG has argued in EITI reporting to date that Requirement 2.2 is not applicable in the mining sector given that Phase I of Argentina's adapted implementation, although it does not appear to have yet reviewed publicly-available information on mining licensing procedures and practices of any of the Provincial Governments, despite provisions in the adapted implementation requiring it to do so. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG noted that information on the legal framework at both the national and provincial levels is available on the Federal Mining Information System (SIFIM) website, providing relevant links. The MSG’s comments highlight an ongoing survey by the Secretariat of Mining (Project PNUD 017/012) of provincial legal frameworks to map licensing and license management procedures in each of the 23 provinces.
With regards to (offshore) oil and gas activities regulated by the Federal Government, EITI reporting provides information on the award of permits and concessions. The 2019 EITI Report indicates that 18 exploration permits were awarded during the period in review through the Round 1 bidding that concluded in early 2019. A link to the list of bidders for each of the licenses awarded in Round 1 is disclosed online and referenced in EITI reporting. The EITI Report briefly describes the two permits and concessions that were transferred during the reporting period. While Argentina's EITI reporting has described the statutory procedure for awarding permits and concessions in the oil and gas sector, including technical and financial criteria, it has not confirmed whether the transfer of concessions and permits (or participating interests therein) are subject to the same procedures, including the same technical and financial criteria, as those pertaining to the award process. There is no evidence that the MSG has undertaken a review of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in permit and concession awards and transfers, nor provided any commentary on the efficiency of licensing and contracting procedures. Industry and government stakeholders confirmed that the technical and financial criteria used during the transfer of permits and concessions are the same used during the award process, although it remains unclear where this is publicly codified."

Progress has especially been made towards the corrective action from the previous validation with regards to describing the process for transferring or awarding licenses in the mining sector including the specific technical and financial criteria. Where licenses were awarded through a bidding process during the year under review in the mining sector, the government has also disclosed information on the list of applicants (including non-winning applicants) in accordance with Requirement 2.2 (c). This is despite perceived legal barriers to disclosure of non-winning bidders as documented by the IA. Albeiti, however, has not yet provided documentation of how the MSG assessed whether there are any non-trivial deviations in the allocation or transfer of licenses in the mining sector in accordance with requirement 2.2 (a) (iv), especially considering that the EITI Report was “not able to conduct an assessment”. No license allocations or transfers were made in the oil and gas sector in the year under review, also confirmed through MSG comments on the draft Validation report."
ac_ei_allocations,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contract and license allocations,"Public overview of awards and procedures for transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses",Europe,Armenia,ac_ei_01,ARM,2,Yes,Fully met,"The International Secretariat’s assessment is that Requirement 2.2 is fully met, as in the previous Validation. The objective of this requirement is to provide a public overview of awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license awards and transfers and whether these procedures are followed in practice. This can allow stakeholders to identify and address possible weaknesses in the license allocation process. Based on documentation and stakeholder consultations, the Secretariat’s assessment is that the objective has been fully met.
The process for awarding permits is clearly laid out in the Subsoil Code and in the EITI Reports covering the periods 2016-2017 and 2018. Any changes to the process can be found in the 2019 and 2020-2021 EITI Reports. This covers two types of permits, for exploration, referred to as geological studies, and production, referred to as mineral extraction. There are no provisions for permit awards through competitive bidding, either statutorily or in practice. The bearer of the right for conducting exploration activities has a priority for receiving the right for mining exploitation. In case of absence of a person with such right, the person first submitting the application receives the permit. There are no mentions of changes in this process in the 2020-2021 EITI Report.
The technical and financial criteria are systematically disclosed in the Armenian Legal Information System under Decision N 367-N promulgated by the Prime Minister. This is also laid out in the 2016-2017 EITI Report. As mentioned above, in case two or more persons have submitted an application with regard to the same subsoil area, the priority is given to the applicant the application of which was registered first, or whoever held the exploration rights. In case the documents provided by the applicant are deficient, or the provided study project, as well as information on financial and technical capacities and resources of the applicant, does not meet the requirements stipulated by the legislation, the MTAI, within a 10-day period, informs the applicant about it. The applicant, within 10 days after receiving the notification, has to address the gaps identified. In case the mentioned gaps are not eliminated within the defined period, the authorised body refuses the application on this basis. 
The process for transferring permits is laid out in the Subsoil Code. The 2016-2017 EITI Report also comments on the practices, rules and relevant government entities regulating transfer of subsoil use rights. The 2020-2021 EITI Report highlights changes to the procedure of transfer of subsoil use rights. Transfers are done by means of transferring ownership or participating interest; the framework does not allow transfers from one company to another. However, the rules and implications of changes in ownership and control of mining permit-holders could be further elaborated.
No permits for metallic mineral exploration or exploitation were awarded or transferred during the period under review, and therefore there are no mentions of deviations in the latest EITI Report. Consultations with government representatives confirmed this. EITI Armenia also confirmed that the EITI process does not cover the non-metallic sector and that the MSG did not specifically review licensing rules and practices related to the non-metallic mining sector given the low materiality of payments from this sub-sector. The MTAI stated that there were seven denied permits during 2020-2021, five rejected permits for exploration and two for extraction. These rejections related to not meeting the technical or financial criteria defined by the law, such as insufficient financial means or not meeting the timeframe stipulated to provide more information, among others.
Representatives of all constituencies confirmed that they have a common understanding of financial and technical criteria for exploration and production permit applications and the award process. Consultations with civil society stakeholders confirmed the change in process for engaging the public in the permit allocation stage in the recent amendments to the environmental law. Stakeholders stated that the amendments restrict the number of hearings from four to two in the initial stage of permit/contract allocation, and one of these is held before the information package is shared with the public. Government representatives confirmed that the changes were meant to increase efficiency and avoid redundancies, as hearings were usually duplicative and required substantial efforts with scarce impact. Civil society stakeholders also raised concerns about the permit allocation decisions, stating that there was no public engagement in the decision-making process. They referred to a case where a company, Mego Gold LLC, was granted a permit years after not operating in a responsible manner and being declared bankrupt. 
While the International Secretariat notes that Armenia EITI has not yet expanded the scope of its EITI implementation to cover the non-metallic mining sector given the low materiality of the value of payments to government from this sub-sector, it does not consider the lack of coverage of non-metallic mining license awards and transfers to constitute a material gap in Armenia’s EITI implementation of Requirement 2.2 given the low materiality of payments from this sector and the fact that non-metallic mining licenses and contracts appear to be comprehensively disclosed (see Requirement 2.4).

While the descriptions of procedures and licence types are comprehensive in the 2020 EITI Report, the EITI's review of material deviations from the applicable legal and regularly framework builds on the work on statutory audit institutions but has not yet been expanded to cover all types of extractive licenses both awarded and transferred in the period under review. More recent audit findings point to underlying governance issues that could be addressed by EITI implementation, given extensive non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in the awards of gold exploration licenses in particular.  

The 2020 EITI Report notes that formal licence allocations and transfers are governed by the Mining Code and by Decree 2017/036 of 26 January 2017 on licence allocation. Mining licences in Burkina Faso are awarded on a first come first serve basis by the DGMG. The MSG comments on the draft Validation report clarify that the award of mining licenses can be based on either a Decree agreed by the Council of Ministers or by order (arrêté) of the Minister of Mines. ANEEMAS also signs agreements with artisanal miners, although the MSG comments on the draft Validation report clarify that these agreements with ANEEMAS relate to management conventions to better oversee artisanal miners, rather than authorisations for artisanal mining activities. The 2020 EITI Report notes that 151 licences were allocated in 2020.78 All licenses awarded in 2020 are listed in Annex 18 of the 2020 EITI Report. The 2020 EITI Report notes that two production licenses, two industrial exploration permits, and one quarrying license were transferred or withdrawn.  

On technical and financial criteria, the EITI Report lists the minimum statutory documents required for awards of exploration permits, industrial small and large-scale mining permits, semi-mechanical artisanal permits, quarrying permits and in the case of competitive bidding. It is noted that exploration permits are subject to verification of the number of exploration licenses held by the applicant, with a maximum of three licenses for natural persons and seven licenses for legal entities. The 2020 report notes that other than the payment of taxes and administrative fees, no precise technical or financial criteria are considered when approving license awards and transfers in Burkina Faso. This was confirmed by several stakeholders during consultations. In its comments on the draft Validation report, the MSG confirms that the only technical and financial criteria that are statutorily defined are those in the technical mining license award guide published on the EITI-BF website. The National Mines Commission, which is in principle responsible for examining applications and giving technical advice, does not publish its work or any summary of the analyses of the feasibility studies (financial, technical, project analysis) submitted to them for license applications, as only reports on environmental impact studies are made available to the public. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue that the EITI Standard does not require the publication of the National Mines Commission’s work. Rather, the National Mines Commission’s work is described as an intermediary step, which leads to the award of mining licenses that are then publicly disclosed once awarded.  

On transfers, there are no details in the EITI Reports on the companies that transferred licences or the names of the companies to whom each licence was transferred. The names of the transferees are indicated on the open data portal79 for 2021, but not for the year under review. In the online cadastre, under the tab “Transactions” it is possible to filter by type “transfer” and status “application granted”, but the information shown does not display the companies involved in the transaction. However, during the period for MSG comments on the draft Validation report in July 2023, the EITI-BF website published a list of mining licenses that were transferred in the period 2020-2023, including the license name and names of companies transferring and receiving each license.  

On renewals, while the report lists 91 renewals, the online cadastre lists 71, an apparent inconsistency. However, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue that such comparisons are not based on correct information, given that the dates of actual license renewals and transfers are not publicly accessible from the online cadastral portal, which only provides the dates at which such renewals and transfers are requested (not the final renewal or transfer decision date). Thus, the MSG comments confirm that the number of 91 renewals quoted in the EITI Report is correct. The draft Validation report also highlighted news reports regarding the transfers of mining licenses to the Turkish company Afro Turk for the manganese site Tambao and the gold mine Inata, which were not documented in the cadastre.80 However, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report explain that the March 2023 decision by the Council of Ministers consisted of an agreement to the transfer of these mining assets, but that the subsequent license award process was only concluded in late June 2023, after which the two license awards were duly recorded in the mining cadastre.  

The 2020 EITI Report, as well as an audit report by the Supreme Audit Institution81 on gold exploration licenses and a Technical General Inspectorate report82, note several deviations from the statutory procedures for the awards, transfers and renewal of licenses. It is to note that the sample reviewed in the EITI Report did not cover licence renewals (91 renewals vs 128 awards). The deviations listed relate to delays in the processing of applications, overlaps in licenses awarded, the lack of monitoring of the mining activities and the partial collection of revenues from these activities. These shortcomings are often noted as a consequence of the high volume of licence applications, renewals and transfers in the country coupled with inadequate financial and human resources at the Ministry and its cadastre department. It is not clear how beneficial owners of companies could be assessed in the current set-up (see Requirement 2.5). The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue strongly that the publication of the results of the review of licensing practices related to gold exploration licenses was sufficient to meet EITI Requirement 2.2.a.iv on the assessment of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in licensing practices.  

Consulted stakeholders did not express any concerns over any governance challenges in licencing practices, other than some industry stakeholders’ concerns over the perception of the administrative process for awarding licenses being excessively time-consuming. The Independent Administrator noted several weaknesses regarding the efficiency of the system of granting these permits, namely a lack of criteria on the technical and financial capacity of the applicant to meet the expected expenditure to implement the work plan and achieve the desired results of the activity in question, and the mass granting of research permits against a limited granting of production licenses. Nonetheless, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue strongly that EITI reporting has provided a sufficient review of non-trivial deviations from statutory licensing procedures in practice. The Secretariat welcomes the publication of the SAI’s audit report on gold exploration licensing practices, but highlights the need for the EITI reporting process to provide an assessment of non-trivial deviations in the awards and transfers of all types of extractive licenses in the period under review. While the EITI process building on the statutory controls by audit authorities is welcomed as an example of good practice, the review of licensing practices should be broadened to cover all types of extractive licenses awarded and transferred in the period under review by each EITI reporting cycle.  

The above-mentioned reports carry important information on the weaknesses of licence allocations and transfers. Given that the 2017-036 decree is currently under review, there is scope for the EITI to seize this opportunity to strengthen the licence allocation system which can be administered by the resources available. EITI-BF may consider with stakeholders how the checking of legal and beneficial owners of licence applicants can be integrated to the administrative workflow, given that currently there are no plans to make beneficial ownership data accessible digitally (through a database) (see Requirement 2.5). The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report reject the reference to beneficial ownership disclosures in relation to the license allocation process, arguing that the assessment of beneficial ownership disclosures should be confined to the assessment of Requirement 2.5. 

On contract awards, the 2020 EITI Report lists the conditions for the signature of a contract and provides a list of active contracts. None was concluded in 2020. It is not clear if any of the terms of the contracts were altered in the period under review (see Requirement 2.4). The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report strongly reject the allegation of opacity in the management of mining contracts in Burkina Faso, arguing that there were no amendments to mining contracts in 2020.

ac_ei_allocations,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contract and license allocations,"Public overview of awards and procedures for transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses",Americas,Colombia,ac_ei_01,COL,1,Partial,Mostly met,"The Secretariat's assessment is that Requirement 2.2 is mostly met. While information on stakeholders’ perception that there were no non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in license awards and transfers in 2020 was confirmed in the period reviewed in the previous Validation, the results of the MSG’s diagnostic of licensing practices was not covered in the 2020 EITI Report or in other publicly accessible documents. The objective of this requirement is to provide a public overview of awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license awards and transfers and whether these procedures are followed in practice. Across the board, stakeholders voiced their satisfaction with the level of transparency in contract and license awards but were less clear where to find publicly accessible information on license transfers in mining and oil and gas. In their comments on the draft Validation report, civil society recommended that there be an annual review of licensing practices and of public consultations carried out as part of the licensing process. The EITI Colombia Secretariat’s comments on the draft assessment argued that the 2021 report and a contracts booklet (‘tableros') provided information on technical and financial criteria assessed in the transfer of mining and hydrocarbons licenses, as well as information on any deviation from statutory licensing procedures. However, while the additional documents clarify the technical and financial criteria assessed for government approvals of license transfers, they did not provide evidence of the MSG’s diagnostic of non-trivial deviations in extractive licensing in 2020 compared to statutory procedures. Thus, the Secretariat considers that the objective remains mostly met pending the completion of EITI Colombia’s annual diagnostic of extractive licensing practices.  

Colombia systematically discloses information on the award of mining licenses, though there were no new awards in the period under review. No information is provided to inform the public of transfers of mining licenses, including for the period under review. In oil and gas, government websites mirror information found in the 2020 EITI Report that shows that four oil and gas licenses were awarded in 2020, which is confirmed by third party sources. Like in mining, there is no information on potential transfers of licenses or participating interests in oil and gas licenses and contracts in the period under review. While technical and financial criteria are defined for the award of mining and oil and gas licenses, it is not clear from public sources whether the same criteria would apply in mining and oil and gas license transfers. It is not clear whether any weightings are applied to technical and financial criteria that value some over others. The EITI Colombia Secretariat’s comments on the draft assessment noted that the technical and financial criteria assessed in mining and hydrocarbons license transfers were contained in the 2021 report and the contracts booklet. Mining licenses can be awarded in three ways, either through “first in, first assessed”, direct negotiations or bid rounds. Stakeholders confirmed that there were no new mining licenses awarded in FY 2020. For oil and gas licenses, bid rounds or direct award by ANH are possible. Government stakeholders confirmed that the four hydrocarbon licenses awarded in 2020 were awarded through bidding rounds. Full lists are provided for both the winners of bidding rounds and unsuccessful bidders.  

The 2020 EITI Report does not provide evidence of a review of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in license awards and transfers in mining or in oil and gas. While the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argued that the findings of the MSG’s review of non-trivial deviations was contained in the 2021 report, the Secretariat could not find evidence of such a diagnostic in the additional documents cited in the MSG’s comments. Some mining industry stakeholders were of the opinion that the process for awarding contracts and licenses was too bureaucratic and time-consuming while oil and gas industry stakeholders noted that bid rounds had resumed after the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the introduction of new bid rounds.

Stakeholder consultations have clarified the procedures in the oil and gas sector, and through the thematic study on contract and license awards published in 2023, Côte d’Ivoire has fulfilled the objective of allowing stakeholders to identify and address possible weaknesses in the license allocation process.
The 2019 EITI Report lists the 42 mining licenses awarded in 2019 and 4 new blocks awarded in the oil and gas sector. Government agencies consulted by the IA stated that only one transfer of a mining license took place in the year under review. However, another mining license seems to have been transferred in 2019 to the company Newcrest, as noted by the IA.  None of the license awards in 2019 were conducted through competitive tender, whether for oil and gas or for mining. For oil and gas, the report does not appear to describe any technical or financial criteria for awards of oil and gas blocks, aside from referring to the assessment of applicants’ technical and financial capacities and referring to the fact that the same criteria are assessed for transfers as for awards The report only refers to the need for applicants to demonstrate past experience as an operator in zones with similar conditions without further detailing the specific technical and financial criteria assessed. Stakeholders consulted considered this situation as a result of the past and present situation of the oil and gas sector in the country, when only few international oil companies apply for blocks, directly negotiating with the State. For mining, the 2019 EITI Report describes the specific technical and financial criteria for awarding the seven different types of mining licenses and confirms that the same criteria apply for mining license transfers as for awards.
The 2019 EITI Report’s note that the MSG’s diagnostic report on mining and oil and gas license awards consisted in a letter sent to the regulatory agencies, respectively DGMG and DGH who confirmed the lack of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures. Côte d’Ivoire EITI Reporting does not reference any additional commentary by the MSG on the efficiency of the current mining and petroleum licensing systems. However, a thematic study has been conducted and published  in February 2023. Using a risk-based approach, it reviewed the practice of awards and transfers in both sectors, allowing for high-level discussions with stakeholders. The verification of the procedures used for the granting and transfer of concessions, contracts, licenses, permits and other rights of exploitation and exploration rights in the mining, oil and gas sector revealed the existence of certain shortcomings related to compliance with regulations and best practices, in particular the lack of documentation required in the award in the oil and mining permits. The study's findings and recommendations were commented on by the entities concerned and discussed by the MSG and non-EITI stakeholders . The implementation of the corrective actions has been integrated to the work plan, and the MSG has expressed the wish to reproduce this exercise in future EITI reports."
ac_ei_allocations,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contract and license allocations,"Public overview of awards and procedures for transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses",Americas,Dominican Republic,ac_ei_01,DOM,2,Yes,Fully met,"The Secretariat's assessment is that Requirement 2.2 is fully met. It should be 
noted that there were no licensing activities in oil and gas in the period reviewed 
in the previous Validation. 
The objective of this requirement is to provide a public overview of awards and 
transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license 
awards and transfers and whether these procedures are followed in practice. 
This can allow stakeholders to identify and address possible weaknesses in the 
license allocation process. Based on available documentation and stakeholder 
consultations, the Secretariat’s assessment is that the objective has been 
fulfilled. Consulted government stakeholders agreed that the objective was 
fulfilled. Disclosures related to the award and transfer of oil, gas and mining 
licenses are comprehensive and technical and financial criteria used in the 
award and transfer process are clearly defined and EITI-DR confirmed that there 
were no deviations from statutory procedure in the award and transfer of licenses 
in the period under review. 
It does appear that the recommendation from the previous Validation to more 
clearly document technical and financial criteria in the award of mining licenses 
has been accomplished. The Dominican Republic systematically discloses 
information on the award and transfer of mining licenses and uses EITI reporting 
to summarise this information and act as a central location for links to various 
government websites where this information is systematically disclosed. Award is 
executed through a first-come, first-served process for most mining areas. In 2020, nine mining licenses were awarded and one mining license was 
transferred. Areas considered to be of importance, so-called ‘fiscal reserves,’ are 
governed by a contractual system where contracts can be awarded using bid 
rounds, though there were no awards in fiscal reserves in the period under 
review. Technical and financial criteria are disclosed for the award and transfer of
mining licenses.
In oil and gas, bid rounds are used to award licenses and the bid round that 
began in 2019 resulted in the award of one oil and gas exploration license. The 
Terms of Reference associated with the 2019 bid round are publicly available 
and contain the bid criteria required to be considered. While there are
documents that should list applicants, these documents only list Apache 
Corporation (the winning applicant). Government stakeholders explained during 
consultations that Apache was the only company that met the pre-application 
standards and was therefore the only company eligible to bid on the license. The 
list of companies that expressed interest but were not eligible to bid is not 
publicly accessible but this does not constitute a gap in Requirement 2.2 given 
that these companies did not meet the pre-application standards to submit bids 
in the 2019 bid round. These stakeholders added that there is not significant 
interest from multinational oil companies in Dominican deposits but that they 
hoped this would change.
During stakeholder consultations and in its response to the draft assessment, 
the MSG confirmed that there were no non-trivial deviations in mining, oil and gas 
license awards and transfers. There is no comment on the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the licensing and contracting systems in the EITI Report, 
although this is only an encouraged aspect of Requirement 2.2.d."
ac_ei_allocations,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contract and license allocations,"Public overview of awards and procedures for transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses",Americas,Ecuador,ac_ei_01,ECU,1,Partial,Mostly met,"The International Secretariat’s assessment is that Requirement 2.2 is mostly met. The objective falls short of being fully met because of gaps in the disclosures of mining license transfers in the period under review (2021) and a lack of information on technical and financial criteria used in mining bid rounds. While bid rounds in the oil and gas sector are published, not all bidders and applicants are listed. Stakeholders did not express particular views on the objective of providing a public overview of awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license awards and transfers and whether these are followed in practice. The Secretariat considers this objective to be mostly fulfilled.  

EITI reporting explains that the process for allocating mining licenses and contracts and hydrocarbon contracts is governed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines, with the Mining Law and Hydrocarbon Law describing the legal and administrative processes for application. In mining, the 2020-2022 EITI Report and the Mining Law describe the different processes for awarding mining licenses, depending on the size of the allotment. Direct negotiation and competitive bidding are used to award mining licenses of all sizes but was not clear from a review of documents if there are technical and financial criteria used in the awards process outside of the bidder proving economic solvency. Guidelines outlining when direct negotiation or competitive bidding is to be used were not found and but in their comments to the draft Validation Report, the Ecuador MSG explained that guidelines on when to use one process over another depends on the size of the concession and whether existing exploration licenses apply to the concession area. In terms of size, small-scale concessions contain exploration and production privileges, whereas medium and large-scale concessions have distinct exploration and production contracting phases. Where a company does not already hold exploration privileges, a bid round is held. Where these exploration privileges already exist, priority is given to the company that conducted exploration activities and direct negotiation is used. During consultations, the IA noted that it was not clear the extent to which technical and financial criteria were used in the award of mining licenses through direct negotiation. While bid criteria for specific competitive bid rounds in the mining sector are publicly available, the list of applicants, outside of the winning bidder, is not disclosed. While EITI documentation did not specify whether mining license transfers are allowed – or the technical and financial criteria associated with them – consultations with government stakeholders clarified that the transfer of mining licenses is permitted for mining concessions, including those involving ENAMI. It is not clear if there were mining license awards or transfers that took place in 2021. More recently, SolGold was awarded a groundbreaking exploitation contract, principally for the production of copper and gold. SolGold held the exploration concession for the deposit and conducted viability studies of the area. In the MSG’s comments to the draft Validation report, they explained that the granting of the exploitation contract to SolGold was to ensure the lasting commitment of both the company and the government to the production phase of this project. International development partners consulted indicated that there were no mining rights granted in 2021 but that there were transfers. Consulted subnational government representatives that form part of the Association of Municipalities of Ecuador added to the information provided by international development partners, noting petitions for mining concessions made through the mining cadastre, the technological platform through which the State grants new mining concessions, have not been adjudicated in a timely manner, resulting in an increase in illegal mining. This linkage between an increase in illegal mining due to the lack of newly awarded mining concessions was also echoed by mining industry stakeholders during the Validation mission. Consulted members of academia posited that while there has been much work to standardise and formalise contract and license allocation processes, this information is not well understood by the public and consulted government stakeholders stressed the importance of formalising mining operations operating without legal backing. There is no evidence that the MSG or IA assessed the mining license award and transfer practices to determine whether there were non-trivial deviations from standard procedure. 

In oil and gas, the 2020-2022 EITI Report and the Hydrocarbon Law describe the scenarios by which oil and gas contracts are awarded through competitive bidding, and in exceptional cases, direct negotiation. Direct negotiation is employed when a foreign state-owned enterprise, or one of its subsidiaries, is to be awarded a hydrocarbon contract. While not a state-owned enterprise, the Gunvor bribery case involving EP Petroecuador where Gunvor used bribes to forego competitive bidding processes when obtaining oil-backed loan contracts illustrates possible risks associated with direct negotiation processes. Instances where EP Petroecuador and foreign state-owned enterprises engage in extractive contracts should be monitored closely by Ecuador MSG. Each bid round is published on the EP Petroecuador website and contains technical and financial criteria with which companies must comply to remain a viable applicant. Information on the applicants of bid rounds does not appear to be publicly accessible, though information on recipients is disclosed. Oil and gas contract transfers are permitted in Ecuador and the technical and financial criteria are described. However, the number of transfers in 2021 is not clear. Additionally, under the Lasso administration, international oil companies were given an opportunity, which is ongoing, to modify existing service-provision contracts to production-sharing contracts. While the MSG indicates in the Transparency template that there were no non-trivial deviations in the award and transfer of contracts, the methodology used to arrive at this conclusion is not provided.  

While information on various bid rounds is published on the EP Petroecuador website, these rounds could be better organized to ease public navigation of complex documents. More broadly, the MSG should assess gaps in publicly available information required and encouraged in Requirement 2.2 and document and explain barriers preventing comprehensive disclosure, with an account of government plans to overcome these barriers and the anticipated timescale for achieving them.

While the Secretariat has identified a gap in the description of license processes and difficulties with assessing the information from regions given different reporting structures, stakeholders consulted for this Validation did not view this issue as a concern.. While D-EITI publishes a centralised overview of changes in licenses, there is a lack of information on transfers of licenses, both on the process and the number of licenses. In its comments to the draft report, the MSG argued for an upgrade to ‘fully met’ given that they consider the absence of description of transfers not to be sufficiently material in fulfilling the underlying objective, and that the decentralised administration of licenses does not allow for a harmonised data set of licence allocations and transfers. The Secretariat is of the view that given that stakeholders did not raise any concerns on the allocation of licenses and that any allocations that deviate from the statutory process for allocations and transfers can be challenged in the administrative court, the underlying objective is fulfilled. Notwithstanding, D-EITI may take strategic considerations into account for disclosures on transfers and on processing inactive licenses.
D-EITI reporting explains that the allocation of mining and petroleum licenses is governed by the Mining Code. Licenses are awarded by regional mining authorities. The EITI Report describes the different types of licenses applicable in the extractive sector and the different processes for granting these. Key steps include the award of the mining right, the agreement of a site-specific workplan and the granting of various environmental permits. D-EITI reporting signposts where in BbergG the criteria for rejecting license applications can be found. The EITI Report does not describe the processes or criteria for transferring or selling a license. BbergG defines criteria for rejecting license transfers but EITI reporting does not identify where to find this information.  In its comments to the draft report, the MSG noted that the regions Hesse and Saxony systematically disclose the description of transferring licenses and that Saxony-Anhalt publishes the full documentation on changes in license holders on the website.  The government considers that this gap is not sufficiently material for ‘mostly met’ and argues for an upgrade of ‘fully met’.
The D-EITI portal provides a spreadsheet that captures information on licenses awarded and transferred between 2018 and 2022 disaggregated by region. Germany could improve the disclosure of information on transfers. The level of detail of disclosure varies by region. In North Rhine-Westphalia, for example, the spreadsheet only lists the current license holder but not the previous owner. This represents an impediment to full public understanding of the parties involved in a transfer. A further challenge arises from the fact that different regions use different terms to describe transfers making it difficult to systematically search the D-EITI spreadsheet. D-EITI reporting does not provide a consolidated overview of all transfers within the reporting period. In its comments to the draft report, the MSG noted that the previous license holders are available through direct inquiry with regional mining authorities. It further noted that the level of detail of public information (as detailed in the spreadsheet) is determined by the regional mining authority’s administration system in line with the degree of relevance of this data for the governance of the sector. The comments further noted that there are a large number of effective and expired mining authorisations or frequent changes of holders of rights, which is why only current license holders are disclosed. The Secretariat is of the view that mining authorities should consider disclosing the number of transfers per year to allow the public to understand what the volume of transfers relative to all active licenses is. In cases where there are numerous inactive licenses (see Requirement 2.3) mining authorities may wish to explain the process and progress of revoking inactive licenses, where for example the company holding the license no longer exists. 
Mining authorities report non-trivial deviations from applicable rules and are also subject to independent audits. D-EITI reporting does not include detail on how checks for non-trivial deviations are conducted, or the MSG’s commentary on the efficiency of licensing procedures, which is encouraged. The International Secretariat’s understanding is that the national secretariat requests mining authorities to disclose material deviations as part of the annual data enquiry and that the MSG has the opportunity to review this information. Civil society and company constituency members did not have any concerns about the approach taken. Within the reporting period, no deviations were reported. In its comments to the draft assessment, the MSG underlined that there were no deviations in the period under review and that the MSG had no mandate to carry out any assessment on the efficiency of the licensing procedure. 
Stakeholders consulted for this Validation did not view the issue described above with concern. While some civil society stakeholders expressed concern over the ability meaningfully influence licensing decisions through public consultations, stakeholders were of the view that there was sufficient transparency over licensing processes and outcomes.

The objective of this requirement is to provide a public overview of awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license awards and transfers and whether these procedures are followed in practice, which will allow stakeholders to identify and address possible weaknesses in the license allocation process. The technical criteria are not fully met yet, given the lack of mining license transfer data for 2020, both in the EITI Report and the online license register, and the lack of information on bidders that participated in the bidding for the bauxite/aluminium licenses. Furthermore, in mining, the assessment of material deviations should be clarified and strengthened to allow to identify weaknesses of the current process, which is part of the objective of this requirement.In mining, most license awards are conducted on a first-come-first-served basis, although competitive tender was employed in one instance. The 2020 GHEITI Mining Report notes that bid rounds were exclusively used from 2019 to 2021 in the award of bauxite/aluminium licenses, where the Ghana Integrated Aluminum Development Corporation (GIADEC) is a shareholder. EITI reporting notes that the usage of competitive tender was a deviation from standard procedure. It is not clear where a list of applicants and bidders can be found for the licenses awarded in this mining bid round. Technical and financial criteria appear to be the same in both awards and transfers and there is no weighting of these criteria in either instance. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report provide a link to a list of license awards in 2020, including cursory information on the license award. 
While the MSG reviewed seven mining licenses to confirm that there were no non-trivial deviations from statutory procedure, it is not clear the methodology used to come to this conclusion. Given the significant backlog in applications (currently over 8000), it would be expected that EITI reporting would potentially serve as a diagnostic to understand what is causing the backlog and how to address the factors causing it. The MSG should review the efficacy of the current license allocation procedure and review its assessment of material deviations.
It is not clear whether there were transfers of mining licenses in 2020, though consulted government representatives confirmed that the mining license transfer process is subject to a stringent checks and balances system that is adhered to in practice. The MSG is invited to clarify if there were any transfers in the year under review.
In oil and gas, the 2020 GHEITI Oil and Gas Report notes that there were no awards of licenses in the period under review, which was mainly attributed to an inefficient bid round process and the advent of COVID-19. The bid round that began in 2019 is still ongoing as winning bidders are still negotiating terms with the state. Consulted government stakeholders involved in the oil and gas licensing process confirmed the absence of new awards of licenses. These stakeholders explained that Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) that were in place to guide negotiations expired and that without new MoUs in place, it was not possible to continue the bid round. In the face of this inefficiency, GHEITI explains that direct negotiations were used to award oil and gas licenses, but this process is also still ongoing. Technical and financial criteria for bid rounds are clearly stated, though it is not clear if there is a weighting to these criteria. Consulted government representatives confirmed that the same technical and financial criteria used in bid rounds are used in direct negotiations. These representatives clarified that most direct negotiations were undertaken with companies previously involved in bid rounds and that if a company that was not involved in bid rounds is selected for direct negotiations, the government will publish an explanation for this selection. While it does not appear that there was a transfer of oil and gas licenses, there was a transfer of participating interests in the TEN and Jubilee fields that involved Occidental, Tullow, PetroSA Ghana Limited and GNPC. The actual transfers of interest are well-documented. , While it was unclear from EITI reporting whether this followed statutory procedure, consulted government representatives confirmed that all transfers of participating interest in the oil and gas sector complied with statutory procedures."

Consulted stakeholders, including the MSG, considered that there has been progress towards achieving the objective of ensuring a public overview of awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses in Indonesia. Nonetheless, there is no publicly available information on the technical and financial criteria used in oil and gas bidding processes as well as an assessment of potential deviations related to awarded licenses/contracts. Following the submission of the draft Validation report to the MSG, additional details were provided to clarify the financial and technical criteria used in evaluating oil and gas bids. In the light of the new information, the Secretariat's assessment is that the objective of this requirement to provide a public overview of awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license awards and transfers and whether these procedures are followed in practice has been mostly fulfilled.   However, the MSG has not conducted an assessment of potential deviations related to awarded licenses or contracts in the mining, oil and gas sectors. Given stakeholders' views and documented cases of corruption risks in the licensing and contracting procedure, further information would be needed to enable stakeholders to exercise oversight on how procedures are followed in practice and to address possible weaknesses in the license allocation process. 
Regarding license allocations in the mining sector, the disclosure of awards in various portals (Indonesia EITI Data Portal and Minerba One Data Portal) is deemed comprehensive overall. In general, the Minerba One Data portal has been characterised as challenging to navigate for accessing and retrieving bulk information. However, it contains comprehensive coverage of license information. A total of 1590 mineral and coal mining licenses are available in the EITI Data Portal with a start date of 2021. The MSG did not clarify the exact number of mining licenses awarded in the period under review (2021). Technical, financial, and administrative criteria are outlined in MEMR Decree Number 258.K/MB.01/MEM.B/2023, which lays out detailed guidelines for granting mining business license areas and special mining business license areas for metallic minerals and coal. The overall process is explained in the  Indonesia EITI Data Portal. There is no mention of deviations or transfers in the EITI Report, and consultations did not provide further insight on this matter. As part of stakeholder consultation, the MSG noted that there had been no transfers in the year under review. It was also noted that there were no material deviations in the practice of granting of mineral and coal mining in 2021. However, there is no evidence that the MSG followed a particular methodology to arrive at that conclusion of a lack of deviations in practice. The MSG also noted during consultations that the MEMR and other government agencies collaborated and reviewed the licensed companies based on the Clear and Clear regulation. 12,000 licenses were assessed under the regulation, following which 6,000 licenses were suspended due to non-compliance. 
Following the submission of the draft Validation report, the MSG provided comments, clarifying the auction and licensing processes for mining awards and transfers. The comments also clarified that a weighting scheme is applied based on provisions in the MEMR Decree No 258 of 2023 (p.77). It also clarified the legal basis for license transfer, as stipulated in the MEMR Decree No. 221 of 2021. The MSG noted that while some deviations in license issuance still occur, increased transparency through established systems and enhanced supervision, including public complaints, should help reduce these issues. There remain no documented method or results of an assessment of material deviations. The MSG plans to routinely request timely auction data and convey frequent inter-ministerial committee meetings on licensing. 
Regarding the oil and gas sector, information in the EITI Report and the EITI Data Portal indicates that three contracts were awarded in 2021. The process for auctions is explained both in the EITI Report and in the EITI Data Portal. The information provided in the EITI Report and feedback from MSG members consulted offered guidance on upstream oil and gas investments, summarising the bidding processes, and the typical terms and conditions in PSCs. However, there is no available documentation of the technical and financial criteria used in these bidding processes, and consultations with stakeholders confirmed that there is no public information on this matter. In addition, as with the mineral and coal mining sector, there are no mentions of deviations or transfers in the EITI Report for oil and gas contract awards. There is no explanation of the transfer process in the EITI Report or the EITI Data Portal, and consultations with stakeholders did not shed any light on these matters. 
Consulted stakeholders expressed appreciation for the improvements in the integration between the MEMR platform and the Online Single Submission (OSS) platform for the license allocation process. According to the MSG, the public can observe the process and participants of the oil and gas rights auction through this portal and the mineral mining sub-sector licensing process through this portal. The MSG has also stated that several stakeholders have welcomed the increased transparency of information regarding bidding rounds and the criteria for the allocation of oil, gas, and mineral mining rights. They have argued that enhanced accessibility to this information is expected to facilitate the participation of civil society and other stakeholders in improving the governance of the extractive industry.
Consultations with stakeholders from anti-corruption bodies have raised that the biggest corruption risks in the extractive sector relate to the potential for bribery and collusion in licensing processes. Two recent cases further illustrate these challenges. The first case concerning Mardani H Maming, a former Tanah Bumbu Regent, resulted in his arrest for corruption, given that he was named as allegedly accepting bribes in exchange for authorising a coal mining license transfer. The second case was an alleged bribery case involving Abdul Gani Kasuba, former Governor of North Maluku Province. Although the latter is not tied to the extractive sector (it concerns infrastructure projects), this further illustrates the risks of politically exposed persons and potential for bribery and collusion in licensing processes. 
Following the submission of the draft Validation report, the MSG provided comments, clarifying the financial and technical criteria used in evaluating the oil and gas bids. These criteria are provided for in detail in the MEMR Regulation No. 35/2021 in Articles 46 (for regular auction of work areas) and 47 (direct offer auctions of work areas). However, the MSG did not clarify whether a weighting scheme is applied in the oil and gas sector. The feedback also clarified the procedure for transfers as per the MEMR Regulation No. 48/2017 (for change of participation interest). However, there remain no documented method or results of an assessment of potential material deviations in the award of oil and gas licenses. The MSG plans to routinely request timely auction data and convey frequent inter-ministerial committee meetings on licensing. The information also includes procedures and grounds for suspending or revoking a contract or license. The MSG agreed to update IEITI disclosures with new information to clarify the auction announcement dates, and coordinate with other working groups for any questions during report preparation."

Opinions were split over whether the objective of transparency in extractive licensing practices had been achieved, with several stakeholders consulted arguing strongly that it had not. The Secretariat’s view is that the objective has not yet been fulfilled, given stakeholder concerns over deviations from statutory license allocation procedures in practice that contradict the findings of Malawi’s EITI reporting. 
The 5th MWEITI Report provides an overview of all new extractive licenses issued in the period under review. Malawi's EITI reporting provides an overview of the statutory procedures followed by the Department of Mines in awarding minerals and petroleum licenses, including technical and financial criteria assessed. There is no discussion in EITI Reporting, or through systematic disclosure, of non-trivial deviations between policy and practice in mining licensing in the period under review, aside from the 5th MWEITI Report's statement that there were no such deviations in the period under review, without a description of the basis for this assessment. 
Most stakeholders consulted highlighted the alleged corruption around the renewal of the Ilomba mining license in the year after the period covered by the latest EITI Report, which led to a formal corruption investigation following an outcry by civil society. This was cited by several stakeholders consulted as an alleged example of significant non-trivial deviations in mining licensing practices. In addition, the EITI Report does not provide an overview of license transfers in the period under review, nor the statutory procedures for transfers of oil and gas contracts and licenses, or participating interests therein. Stakeholder consultations indicate that at least two license transfers had taken place in this period. In its comments on the draft assessment and Annex 2 to them, the MWEITI MSG confirms that there are clear procedures for contract and license allocations, but does not comment on the contract and license transfers in the period under review."

Mexico systematically discloses some information on the award of mining concessions and oil and gas licenses and contracts. However, while the 2018 EITI Report identifies the awards of mining licenses in 2018, it does not identify the number of license transfers. In oil and gas, the MSG states that there were no new license or contract awards or transfers in 2018, although third-party sources indicate that several dozen new oil blocks were awarded to international oil companies in 2018 through the conclusion of Bid Rounds 2.4 and 3.1 and there appear to have been some transfers of participating interests in oil and gas blocks. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG confirmed that there were no new awards of oil and gas licenses and contracts in 2018 aside from those through Bid Rounds 2.4 and 3.1. While Mexico’s EITI reporting has described the statutory procedure for awarding licenses and contracts in the mining, oil and gas sectors, with technical and financial criteria systematically disclosed on government websites, it has not described the process for transferring licenses or contracts (or participating interests therein), including criteria assessed. Nonetheless, information on the statutory procedure for transferring oil and gas contracts (or participating interests therein) is publicly disclosed through the official gazette., In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG explained that the general process for transferring participating interests in oil and gas contracts was described in the “Guidelines establishing the requirements and procedure for entering into alliances or associations in which the transfer of corporate and management control or control of operations is carried out” issued by the CNH, although they noted that a detailed overview of the statutory transfer procedure was not available to the public. Yet the MSG noted that the CNH’s decisions regarding approvals of transfers were recorded in the CNH Governing Council’s resolutions published in its public registry. The MSG does not appear to have undertaken a review of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedure in license and contracts awards and transfers in either mining or oil and gas. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG highlighted that six oil and gas contracts had had modifications approved by the CNH in 2018, providing specific references to the relevant resolutions published on the official gazette website. Oil and gas licenses and contracts can be awarded through competitive tender, with information on the bid criteria and full list of bidders for each awarded block systematically disclosed on the Rondas website. The MSG has not yet used EITI reporting to provide a diagnostic of the efficiency of the licensing and contracting procedures in either mining or oil and gas.
The Secretariat’s assessment that Requirement 2.2 is mostly met strikes a balance between robust systematic disclosures of license awards and transfers in the oil and gas sector on the one hand and weaker relevant systematic disclosures in the mining sector."
ac_ei_allocations,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contract and license allocations,"Public overview of awards and procedures for transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses",Asia and the Pacific,Mongolia,ac_ei_01,MNG,1,Partial,Mostly met,"The Secretariat's assessment is that Requirement 2.2 is mostly met. Stakeholders consulted did not express any views about whether the objective of transparency in extractive rights licensing practices had been fulfilled through EITI reporting, although several stakeholders from all constituencies considered that there had been deviations from statutory procedures for MRPAM’s licensing in the period under review given the government’s award of mining licenses to SOE through cabinet resolution rather than through competitive tender. The Secretariat’s view is that the previous EITI Mongolia diagnostic of licensing practices has not been replicated for EITI reporting covering the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years and thus that the objective of identification of possible weaknesses in the license allocation process has been mostly fulfilled in the period under review. 
Systematic disclosures by the regulator MRPAM through its monthly statistical bulletins identify the extractive licenses awarded, while EITI reporting has disclosed information on both extractive license and contract awards and transfers. There were 90 awards and 83 transfers of mining rights in 2020, but no licensing activity in the oil and gas sector. Mongolia's 2020 EITI Report describes the statutory procedure for awarding and transferring mineral rights, but only describes the technical criteria for awards through competitive tenders, not the technical and financial criteria assessed for transfers. Government officials and the IA confirmed in consultation that the Minerals Law referred to technical and financial criteria for mineral license awards in general terms, but that the regulations only codified detailed technical criteria, which were summarised in the EITI Report, no financial criteria. Stakeholders consulted thus assumed that financial criteria were not assessed in practice in mining license awards. Consultations also indicated that the description of the transfer process in the 2020 EITI Report was accurate, and that no technical or financial criteria were assessed with regards to the company receiving the transferred license. In its comments on the draft assessment, the EITI Mongolia Secretariat noted that the latest (2020) EITI Report had disclosed the criteria for awarding extractive licenses, but that further improvements were needed in future EITI Reports. However, Mongolia’s recent (2019 and 2020) EITI Reports no longer review the practice of license and contract awards and transfers in the period under review, as previous EITI Reports (e.g., for 2016 and 2017) had done in the period reviewed under the previous Validation. In addition, the full list of bidders for each mining license awarded through competitive tender in 2020 does not appear to be publicly disclosed. Some stakeholders highlighted public perceptions of corruption risks in the minerals licensing process. Stakeholders consulted from all constituencies highlighted the government’s plans to amend the Minerals Act in 2022 to transition to online license applications and awards, as well as reintroducing first-come-first-served awards for mineral exploration licenses. This presents an opportunity for EITI Mongolia to integrate an oversight mechanism into the licensing process, a process to which annual EITI reporting could contribute. 
Despite the lack of oil and gas rights awards and transfers in 2020, the EITI Report describes the statutory procedures for awarding and transferring oil and gas rights, although it is unclear whether the same technical and financial criteria apply to transfers of rights as to the initial awards of the licenses. Government officials consulted explained that they did not assess any criteria in transfers provided there were no changes in the terms of the PSA. Amendments to the terms of the contract would be treated as a new award by the regulator MRPAM, according to officials consulted. Thus, the Secretariat’s view is that Mongolia has used its EITI reporting to clarify the statutory procedures for extractive license and contract awards but has not extended this to documenting licensing practices since 2018.

There were different opinions among stakeholders consulted over the level of progress towards the objective of transparency in the awards and transfers of oil, gas and mining licenses, the statutory procedures for license awards and transfers and whether these procedures are followed in practice. Several government officials considered that the objective had been fulfilled, while several CSOs and development partners consulted considered that the objective was still far from being fulfilled given the lack of public information on license awards outside of formal oil and gas bid rounds. The Secretariat’s assessment is that the objective is not yet fulfilled given limited public availability and accessibility of the statutory licensing procedures, particularly related to the transfer of participating interests in oil and gas blocks, combined with the lack of NEITI diagnostic of the actual licensing practices as part of its EITI reporting. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report argued for an upgrade in the assessment of Requirement 2.2 to ‘mostly met’. The comments considered that the assessment of ‘partly met’ on the basis of a lack of review of the practice of licensing was too harsh compared to other EITI countries. Noting that the legal and regulatory environment for awarding extractive licenses in 2020 had not changed compared to the period reviewed by the previous Validation, when Nigeria was assessed as having achieved ‘satisfactory progress’ on Requirement 2.2. The Secretariat recognises that the assessment of Requirement 2.2 is borderline between ‘partly met’ and ‘mostly met’ based on progress in addressing the technical aspects of the requirement. However, the Secretariat’s view is that, on balance, the objective is still far from being fulfilled given the lack of clarity around statutory procedures for transfers of participating interests in oil and gas blocks prior to the PIA combined with a lack of diagnostic of any deviations from statutory procedures in licensing practices in the year under review, given the legacy of public mistrust in licensing practices in the petroleum sector. Thus, the Secretariat concludes on an assessment of Requirement 2.2 as partly met.  

In mining, Nigeria systematically discloses information on the award and transfer of mining licenses. The 2020 NEITI Solid Minerals Report notes the number and identities of mining license awards and transfers in the period under review and provides links to where this information is systematically disclosed in published reports of the Mining Cadastre Office (MCO). Upon review of the MCO register, it was found that the identities of three transfer recipients were missing, though government representatives from the MCO that were consulted noted that this was an oversight, and this information would be added. This oversight was also noted by the Independent Administrator during consultations.  Information on licenses allocated prior to 2020 is also disclosed, though this is not required. However, the number of awarded mining licenses noted in the 2020 NEITI Solid Minerals Report differs from that found in the MCO’s Register. Government officials consulted confirmed that there had been 1541 licenses awarded in 2020 as reflected in the MCO register, rather than the 1481 license awards referenced in the 2020 NEITI Report. Nigeria's Solid Minerals EITI Reporting has described the statutory procedure for awarding licenses and contracts in the mining sector, with technical and financial criteria for awards and transfers, though it is unclear whether any weighting is applied to the different criteria. A government official consulted confirmed that the same technical and financial criteria were used in assessing applications for license transfers as for awards, and that there were no weightings applied to the different criteria assessed for awards through first-come-first-served. The official also explained that the technical and financial criteria assessed for awards through competitive tenders differed according to the bid round. Mining licenses can be awarded through a first-in first-assessed model or through bid rounds. Several government officials consulted explained that bid rounds could be held for awarding mining licenses based on a decision of the Minister of Mines and Steel Development. They also confirmed that all mining licenses had been awarded through first-come-first-served in 2020. The MSG does not appear to have undertaken a review of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedure in license and contract awards, though the IA notes that transfers adhered to statutory procedures without indicating how this conclusion was reached. In consultations, the IA explained that it had reviewed documentation of the eight steps for awarding mining licenses but had found that some documentation was missing, with the MCO proving unresponsive to the IA’s follow-up for additional information on these apparent deviations from statutory procedures. The MSG has not yet used EITI reporting to provide a diagnostic of the efficiency of the licensing and contracting procedures in mining. A government official consulted highlighted that the recent launch of the MCO’s mining license application software, based on the EMC+ cadastral management system, provided the basis for managing license applications online, but noted that the migration to this new system was still ongoing.  

In oil and gas, the 2020 NEITI Report lists two oil and gas licenses awarded and two licenses transferred in 2020. While the license information provided in annex to the 2020 report lists three licenses renewed in 2020, government officials consulted explained that these were not considered new awards but rather simple extensions of the relevant licenses. With regards to OML 119, which is marked as expiring in 2020 in the 2020 NEITI Report, officials consulted explained that NPDC had applied for its extension in 2020 but that the license extension was still pending given differences over arrears in payments to government related to that license. This was considered significant by some stakeholders consulted given that oil liftings from OML 119 were recorded to have continued to be used in repayment of the ‘Project Eagle’ resource-backed loan in 2021 according to NNPC’s systematic disclosures of oil sales (see Requirement 4.3).  

General descriptions of the process for awarding and transferring oil and gas rights are available in government documents published on the NEITI website, although there does not appear to be available information on the process for transferring oil and gas rights in the Nigeria-STP Joint Development Zone. Government officials consulted confirmed that there had been no licensing activity in the JDA in 2020. However, the specific technical and financial criteria assessed in the award and transfer of oil and gas rights, and any weightings applied to specific criteria, are not described in the public domain, even though the applicable regulations require the government regulator (formerly the DPR, now NUPRC) to assess the technical and financial capacities of the applicant. Government officials consulted explained that the 1969 Petroleum Act allowed for the Minister of Petroleum Resources to award licenses through direct negotiations, but without clarifying the criteria assessed in the process. The DPR Guidelines for assigning interests in oil and gas blocks defined some criteria and associated weightings, which were considered to apply for the Ministerial consent both for transfers and for awards through direct negotiations. The NSWG comments on the draft Validation report argued that the Validation report had taken insufficient account of provisions in the statutory licensing regime allowing for discretionary awards of oil and gas licenses without any objective criteria set. The comments highlighted that the overview of the process for transferring oil and gas licenses was disclosed on the NEITI website, together with guidelines for asset divestments. With regards to the statutory procedures for awarding oil and gas licenses in the Nigeria-STP JDZ, the NSWG comments explained that the specific technical and financial criteria were set in advance of any tender process, but that there were no such criteria to report for 2020 given the lack of tender processes ongoing at the time. The government officials consulted explained that the bid documents for the 2020 marginal fields bid round that concluded in 2022 included the assessed criteria and their weightings, but all of these documents were no longer publicly accessible given that the bid round website was taken offline after the awards of these blocks and NEITI had not published a back-up of this information. It was noted that a ‘mini bid round’ was being conducted at the time of consultations (February 2023) and that information on the bid criteria and their weightings were publicly available. Government officials noted that licensing was now far better regulated under the 2021 PIA. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report raised concerns that the “remarkable transformation” in the process for awarding oil and gas licenses under the 2021 PIA had been insufficiently acknowledged in the Validation report.  

Although the 2020 NEITI Report on Oil & Gas concludes on the absence of any non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in the award of two oil and gas blocks in 2020, the report does not comment on NEITI’s assessment of the transfers of two oil and gas rights in 2020, nor on the renewal of three oil and gas blocks in 2020. Of equal concern, NEITI’s methodology in assessing non-trivial deviations in awards and transfers remains unclear based on publicly available documents. The IA and Secretariat staff explained that documentation on the process for awarding and transferring oil and gas licenses in 2020 had been requested from the DPR, but that these documents had not been provided. While DPR staff had promised to provide a report on the licensing in 2020, this had not been provided. Thus, the statement in the 2020 NEITI Report should be understood to mean that the IA did not review any documentation indicating that there had been deviations from statutory procedures. A senior government official stated that this information would be provided in future by the new regulator NUPRC if requested by NEITI. Industry representatives consulted did not express any views on the issue of deviations from statutory licensing procedures.  

There were no awards of oil and gas rights through competitive tender in 2020 given that the 2020 Marginal Fields Licensing Round only concluded in 2022, although there is no evidence that NEITI has yet produced a review or other information listed in Requirement 2.2.c in relation to the oil and gas marginal fields awarded through tender in 2022. Government officials consulted stated categorically that there had been no deviations from statutory procedures in the marginal field round. Weaknesses in NEITI disclosures related to transfers of oil and gas rights are a particular concern given the dominance of transfers since the last oil and gas licensing round held in 2007 and a history of alleged irregularities in transfers of oil and gas rights in Nigeria.

Stakeholders consider that the publicly available information on oil and gas licence allocations and transfers to be comprehensive and that the oversight mechanisms in place are sufficient to detect irregularities. The requirement is exceeded due to the data being systematically disclosed.  

Decisions on opening specific fields to the licensing process and allocation of licenses to the Norwegian State’s Direct Financial Interest (SDFI) are made by the Cabinet of Ministers based on recommendations from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE). Licensing rounds are then managed by MPE, which published detailed information on the processes, including criteria for awarding licensees, and an overview of companies that have prequalified or are in the process of qualification to participate. The award process begins with an assessment of bids by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) according to the announced criteria. Though it is not clear from this information how technical and financial criteria are weighed, NPD clarified in consultations that financial criteria are “threshold criteria”, while technical competencies are evaluated against the needs of the area to be developed. The NPD proposes consortia for each license and negotiates with companies on issues such as time schedule and work obligations. Negotiated license consortia are then approved by the Norwegian Cabinet of Ministers and formalized by the King in Council. A licence is considered awarded when the companies in the joint venture enter the Agreement for Petroleum Activities, and disclosed as described in regard to Requirement 2.3, in addition to an overview of all companies that participate in each licensing round. In 2020, only licenses for mature areas were granted, a total of 69 licences. Consultations clarified that a modest application handling fee is the only cost for applying companies.
   
Licenses may be transferred if a participant in a licence decides to relinquish their participation or if there is a change in their participating interest or company name, but requires approval of the MPE and the MoF, according to the same criteria applied to license awards. This is a commercial transaction, and the Government collects no transfer fees. The same process is applied to partial direct or indirect transfers of ownership shares or rights, in which case the MPE may assign a transfer fee “in special cases”. All license transfers and material changes are recorded in license records and are downloadable from the NPD website in interactive format. 
 
There are no formal mechanisms for oversight of the license allocation process or identification of deviations from statutory procedures. Consultations revealed a high degree of trust among all stakeholder groups that the checks and balances inherent in the governance of the sector were sufficient in this regard, including annual sector audits and ad hoc audits performed by the Supreme Audit Institution, Riksrevisjonen. This Validation understands that there have been no material deviations in the year under review. Despite broad trust in the allocation and management process, some stakeholders consulted for this Validation expressed concerns about how decisions are made to open new licenses in frontier areas, particularly in regard to environmental concerns, and articulated a desire for more detailed performance audits.

PNG has provided some additional information regarding the technical and financial criteria for awarding licenses, and stakeholders did not express doubts about the comprehensiveness of disclosures of license awards and transfers.
The objective of this requirement is to allow stakeholders to identify and address possible weaknesses in the license allocation process. Stakeholder consultations suggest that there are shortcomings in the oversight mechanisms for license awards and transfers. Information about licenses awarded and transferred in 2019 is publicly available, as well as an overview of the process. However, there is no indication of an assessment of whether the the awards and transfers of mining, oil and gas contracts and licenses in 2019 deviated from the applicable legal and regulatory framework. The detailed technical and financial criteria for awarding mining licenses do not appear to be available on government websites, but in the Transparency template submitted by the MSG at the beginning of this Validation, the MSG indicated some questions that are considered in assessing a mining tenement application.
For the oil and gas sector, licenses awarded and transferred in 2019 are listed on the DPE website.  The process and criteria for awarding oil and gas licenses are described in Petroleum Policy Handbook section 2.5, which is publicly available, although how the assessment criteria is applied remains unclear. No licenses were awarded through a bidding process in 2019.  Transfers of oil and gas licenses are registered by the DPE, but are regarded as private transactions between third parties, so no prior approval is required by the DPE. The DPE as regulatory authority has no insight or input into license transfers as such, and stakeholders consulted for this Validation described this as a regulatory gap for the extractives sector, noting that it inhibits any kind of oversight, and inhibits DPE’s ability to generate license fees and reporting. Stakeholders also noted specific examples of oil and gas licenses that had changed hands repeatedly without any regulatory oversight. 
For the mining sector, the 2019 EITI Report provides an annexed overview of tenements awarded or extended in 2019, as reported by the MRA. The 2019 EITI Report summarises the process for awarding mining tenements. However, the detailed process and technical and financial criteria for awarding tenements are not published. The MSG indicated in private correspondence in preparation for this Validation that awards are based on the MRA’s interpretation of the Mining Act. Stakeholder consultations thus suggest that there exists an assessment tool that the MRA applies that is not publicly disclosed. The Transparency file indicates the questions considered in the assessment. These are mostly related to financial criteria. Considering that the Mining Act (Part V) does not include details about the technical and financial criteria for awarding tenements and that it grants the Minister discretion in deciding on awards, the lack of clear publicly available criteria used in the process is considered a material gap by the International Secretariat. 
According to the 2019 EITI Report, no mining tenements were transferred in 2019. The EITI Report provides a summary description the process according to which the MRA transfers mining tenements.
The MSG argued in its feedback on the draft Validation report that the requirement should be assessed as Mostly met. The MSG points to legal obstacles related to contract disclosure. MRA notes in the MSG’s comments that it could disclose additional documentation upon approval by its management. The MSG’s feedback does not address the gaps identified in the preliminary assessment. Therefore, the Secretariat continues to consider the requirement as Partly met with considerable improvements since the previous Validation."

The MSG’s ‘Transparency’ template considers the objective of transparency in licensing practices is mostly fulfilled. Consulted stakeholders did not express particular views on the fulfilment of the objective . The International Secretariat considers that, with the additional information provided through stakeholder consultations, the objective of this requirement is mostly fulfilled.
In the mining sector, information about the process for awarding licenses, including technical and financial criteria, and contracts is clearly documented through EITI reporting and on government websites. The Institute for Geology, Mining and Metallurgy (INGEMMET) is responsible for processing licensing requests on a first come, first served basis.  Consulted government stakeholders confirmed that a first come, first served system is the only method for awarding mining licenses. In their comments to the draft Validation Report, the MSG clarified the process for mining license transfers, mining suspension and mining cessation, noting that these laws and regulations are found in the General Mining Law. Technical and financial criteria for mining license transfers is clearly documented in these laws and regulations. MSG comments to the draft Validation Report explained that actual transfers that occurred in the period under review, including the identity of the license and its recipients, is publicly available through the SUNARP online portal, upon request. These stakeholders noted that they will consider detailing this information in future EITI reports for ease of access. 
While less prevalent than mining licenses, there are also Guarantee Contracts for the Promotion of Investment in the mining sector that can be awarded through direct negotiation to large-scale mining projects above USD 20 million. The process for the award of these contracts is available on the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) website and is briefly summarised through EITI reporting, although it does not appear that the 2021-2022 EITI Report notes recent modifications to these regulations. EITI reporting could be used to summarise these modifications to regulations governing stability contracts described through MINEM publications. MSG comments to the draft Validation Report confirmed the International Secretariat’s understanding that the transfer of mining contracts is between private individuals and outside the remit of mining authorities’ approval. These comments confirmed that there were no transfers of mining contracts in 2022.
In terms of mining license allocations in 2022, systematic disclosures through the MINEM mirror information found in the 2021-2022 EITI Report and ‘Transparency’ template, reporting the award of 3,739 mining titles. Information on the award of mining titles is available for previous years and also include basic data on sustainability contracts entered into with mining companies and the expected date that these activities will begin. Available documentation and stakeholder consultations did not comment on the efficiency and effectiveness of licensing procedures, which is encouraged. In terms of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedure, government stakeholders indicated that there was a system in place to ensure that awards adhered to regulations without indicating what this system was. The MSG did not communicate their view on the robustness of the assessment of deviations. There is no information available on the review of the transfers of licenses. 
License allocation in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector is under the purview of the Regional Directorate for Energy and Mines, as noted in successive EITI Reports. There is little information on license allocations in this sector for the period under review other than an explanation of the concession size that indicates it as an ASM mining area. During consultations, government stakeholders noted that many subnational governments do not have the personnel or technical capacity to properly handle ASM license allocation tasks. Links to where information can be found in ASM license allocations and transfers in the period under review do not appear to be available. 
In the oil and gas sector, information about the process for awarding contracts, including the technical and financial criteria, is described on Perupetro’s website and in the 2020-2021 EITI Report. Additional information on technical and financial criteria can be found in the regulations associated with the Hydrocarbon Law. Perupetro is charged with negotiating oil and gas contracts with international oil companies (IOCs). These contracts can take the form of license contracts, service contracts and other types of related contracts, such as transport contracts and are entered into through direct negotiation and competitive bidding. Processes used in competitive bidding are clearly outlined on Perupetro’s website and a list of approved bidders can be found on the SOE’s website as well. This list, however, is incomplete without a full list of bidders, including those that were not selected. EITI reporting does not clearly indicate the procedure for transferring oil and gas contracts but consulted government stakeholders clarified that these are allowed and conducted through Supreme court decrees. It is not clear whether such transfers took place in the period under review. While there are clear technical and financial criteria used in the award process, government stakeholders confirmed during consultations that there is no weighting of these criteria during the transfer of oil and gas contracts.
The 2021-2022 EITI Report notes that there was one production contract awarded in 2021 and zero contracts awarded in 2022. Up to date figures on oil and gas exploration and production contracts can be found on Perupetro’s website (here) and includes active contracts entered into before EITI implementation began in Peru. Data related to oil and gas contract transfers in the period under review does not appear to be available. Available documentation and stakeholder consultations did not comment on the efficiency and effectiveness of contracting procedures."

Mining: The 6th PH-EITI Report lists the licenses and contracts awarded in 2018, describes the statutory procedure for awards and transfers and the MSG has undertaken a review of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in practice in 2018, although stakeholders expressed concerns that consultation processes were not always followed in practice. However, as confirmed in the MSG’s comments on the draft assessment, the MGB has confirmed the lack of new mining license contract and license awards in 2018. The technical and financial criteria assessed for mining license and contract awards and transfers are described in the public domain and government officials confirm that there is no weighting applied to the criteria, even if this is not explicitly stated in disclosures on the MGB website. None of the mining licenses and contracts appear to have been awarded through bidding in 2018. Coal, oil and gas: The 6th PH-EITI Report and online government sources list the one new oil and gas contract award in 2018, while the MSG’s comments refer to a published letter from the DOE confirming the lack of any new coal contract awards or transfers in this period. The minutes of MSG meetings indicate that the DOE was expected to subsequently confirm whether there were any transfers of interests in oil and gas contracts in 2018, although there is no public record (nor reference in the MSG’s comments) of the DOE's clarification of the number of transfers in oil and gas contracts in 2018. The general procedures for awarding and transferring coal, oil and gas contracts are described, including an assessment of non-trivial deviations in practice. Public sources define the technical and financial criteria assessed for coal, oil and gas contract awards and transfers, but do not clarify whether any weightings are applied to criteria assessed in transfers.

Senegal’s EITI reporting has provided annual disclosures of the numbers and identities of licenses awarded and transferred, the general award and transfer procedures and has been transparent about the lack of technical and financial criteria until the publication of the Ministry of Mines and Geology’s Procedural Manual and the 2020 Decree implementing the 2019 Petroleum Code. The MSG has prepared diagnostic reports on licensing practices in the mining sector, as a means of informing public policy making and reforms. All the 97 mining license awards have been reviewed by an independent consultant. The results, including the assessment of non-trivial deviations, are available in the annex 3 of the study. Based on the review, the MSG has also made recommendations to licensing authorities in Senegal, such as using the newly adopted manual of procedures to assess future awards and transfers of extractive licenses. However, the Secretariat’s assessment is that the MSG’s assessment of non-trivial deviations in practice did not fulfil the MSG’s own Terms of Reference for this diagnostic assessment, raising concerns over the comprehensiveness of the study’s findings, given the lack of availability of documentation related to some of the license awards reviewed. Given the lack of new oil and gas license awards and transfers in 2019, the MSG did not carry out the same type of diagnostic work on petroleum license awards and transfers, either for 2019 or earlier periods. Therefore, the Secretariat’s assessment is that the objective of Requirement 2.2 has not yet been fulfilled given that Senegal EITI’s review of non-trivial deviations in the mining sector has not yet been replicated in the oil and gas sector, despite significant public attention to petroleum licensing practices.

The objective of allowing stakeholders to identify and address possible weaknesses in the license allocation process has been mostly fulfilled. The assessment of possible deviations from the statutory framework is based on a random selection of licenses awarded in 2019. The MSG argued in its feedback on the draft Validation report that the requirement should be considered as fully met. It welcomed recommendations on further strengthening the methodology for assessing non-trivial deviations. However, it noted that as the Standard did not provide clear guidance on how deviations should be investigated, they should not be sanctioned for the selected methodology. The Secretariat recognises the efforts made by the MSG, as well as by government agencies, to investigate and address deviations related to the process for awarding mining licenses. However, the Secretariat’s assessment is that considering recent concerns related to deviations in the allocation of mining licenses, fully achieving the objective of the requirement requires strengthening the methodology.
For mining, the Mines and Minerals Act lays out the procedure for the award of mining licenses and EITI reporting adds value by providing additional information concerning large-scale and some small-scale mining licenses. Mining licenses and rights are granted through a ‘first come first assessed’ procedure. All information listed under Requirement 2.2 is disclosed for mining license awards and transfers through EITI reporting and the National Minerals Agency website. A comprehensive list of all mining licenses can be found through the National Minerals Agency MCAS System, which enables searching licenses by date of award. It appears that information of all licenses awarded in the period under review (2019) has been disclosed. EITI reporting and stakeholder consultations suggest that no mining licenses were transferred in 2019. Specific technical and financial criteria used in the application and transfer processes are clearly outlined. However, technical and financial criteria do not appear to be weighted but are rather required to be documented in a company’s application materials, meaning that all technical and criteria are assessed equally. 
To confirm that there were no non-trivial deviations in the award and transfer of mining licenses and rights, four companies – two with large-scale and two with small-scale mining licenses – were required to present further documentation. Upon review, no material deviations from the applicable legal and regulatory framework were found. However, previous EITI reporting identified Kingho Investment Limited as deviating from standard bidding procedure before being awarded a license and while this license has since been cancelled, Kingho remains active in Sierra Leone and could have been selected for further review, especially in light of Kingho’s lack of provision of beneficial ownership information and audited financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year. Concerning Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and the adherence to statutory procedures, the 2019 Auditor General’s Report identified at least 16 licenses that were awarded without EIA licences thus contravening Sections 108 (a) and 98 (a) of the Mines and Minerals Act of 2009. Consulted stakeholders noted that in the past, a lack of communication between the EPA and the NMA led to gaps in the process, but that improved communication has led to improved monitoring of and application for these assessments during the license award process. In addition, stakeholders noted that civil society active in the EITI had undertaken advocacy to ensure that deviations were addressed.
With regards to the oil and gas sector, EITI reporting corroborates information found on the Petroleum Directorate website on the award of licenses. For the 2019 fiscal year, there were no oil and gas licenses awarded and the only active oil and gas license belongs to Innoson Oil and Gas, which was awarded a license on 1 April 2021 through the Round 4 Tender process that concluded in 2020. The fourth Offshore Petroleum Licensing Round was initially launched in January 2018 for a six-month period but after delays, it was re-launched in May 2019 and concluded in February 2020 with one exploration license awarded to Innoson Oil & Gas on 1 April 2021 (the award of this license has yet to be ratified by Parliament). While the licensing round began during the period under review, the awarding of the license took place after 2019. The EITI Report notes that there were no oil and gas licenses awarded in the period under review. Oil and gas licenses can be granted through direct negotiations or through a competitive tender process but neither government sources nor the 2019 EITI Report defines when one process is to be used over the other. Financial and technical criteria, including weighting of specific criteria, is well explained but it is not clear whether the same technical and financial criteria are to be used during license transfers as during the initial awards process. Likewise, it remains unclear whether there are concrete steps required for the transfer of licenses outside of a value judgement made by the Minister of the Petroleum Directorate. Gaps in statutory procedures for transfers in mining and oil and gas are not material given that in practice, the 2019 EITI Report confirms that there were no transfers in 2019."

Stakeholders consulted did not express particular views on progress towards the objective of transparency in licensing practices. The Secretariat considers that this objective is mostly met given the lack of clarity on the details of the statutory procedure for extractive rights awards and transfers and the lack of review by TL-EITI of non-trivial deviations from this framework in practice.  

The government systematically discloses some information on the award of mining licenses and oil and gas PSCs. While the 2019 EITI Report identifies the mining licenses awarded in 2019, it does not adequately describe the awards process, nor the technical and financial criteria considered. The mining sector is considered to be not material, but there appear to be individual mining companies that make payments above the USD 100,000 materiality threshold. 

The transfer of licenses is not permitted in the mining sector, although they are allowed in oil and gas. Following the implementation of new oil and gas regulations through the MBT, there were four oil and gas licenses transferred in 2019, which involved the transfer of ownership from Australia to Timor-Leste but within the same operating consortium of companies. An additional transfer of participating interests in an oil and gas contract occurred in 2019 when the participating interests in ConocoPhilips and Shell were acquired by Timor GAP. While evidence suggests that this transfer was approved by the government, the EITI Report does not describe the statutory procedure for transferring participating interests in oil and gas projects.   

A new bidding round was initiated at the end of 2019 but it appears that all bidders and awards occurred in subsequent years. Technical and financial criteria for this second bidding round are clearly laid out in public government sources and it appears that all criteria are weighted equally. The MSG does not appear to have undertaken a review of non-trivial deviations from the statutory procedure in license and contract awards and transfers in either mining or oil and gas. A government official consulted explained that the ANPM’s assessments of applications for new licenses were considered confidential and thus not disclosed to the public. The government official noted in consultation that there had been no non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in the awards and transfers that took place in 2019, although this assessment was only provided orally and is not publicly accessible (it also remains unclear whether the MSG has considered this government official’s assessment of non-trivial deviations).  

None of the license awards in the mining sector in 2019 appear to have been based on competitive bidding, which was confirmed by government officials consulted. The list of bidders for oil and gas contracts awarded through competitive bidding in subsequent years does not appear to be disclosed on government websites. The MSG has not yet used EITI reporting to provide a diagnostic of the efficiency of the licensing and contracting procedures in either mining or oil and gas. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG only referred to the public disclosure of summaries of seven oil and gas PSCs, but without providing clarifications on the process for awarding and transferring PSCs.

EITI reporting includes a description of the processes for awarding licenses, PSAs and other types of agreements. The EITI Report provides a step-by-step description of different awards processes. The Ukrainian Geological Survey has stated that there were no deviations from statutory procedures in award processes within the reporting period. The MSG has also not detected any deviations. 
Auctions for licenses are managed through a government portal. The EITI Report includes information on auctions held in 2022, including the winners and applicants. Stakeholders have described the government portal as world-leading from a transparency perspective. The EITI Report notes that decisions on license awards are primarily based on financial factors, i.e., licenses are awarded to the highest bidder. Regulations also stipulate several grounds for refusal to grant a license, including the absence of beneficial ownership information or discrepancies between the information provided and information contained in the government’s beneficial ownership register (see below).
Awards of PSAs are also competitive but are not managed electronically. Technical and financial criteria are defined by the cabinet of ministers and disclosed to the public. Stakeholder did not express any concerns related to potential transparency gaps related to PSA awards.
For the year under review, 295 licenses were awarded in the extractive sector in total. From the mining sector, 246 licenses were awarded, 158 of them without bidding processes.
In the oil and gas sector, there were 49 license awards, of which 48 were awarded without auction.
According to the EITI Report, no transfers took place in 2022. A temporary legislation was implemented, prohibiting any license transfers in the extractive sector, oil and gas or mining.
It has been confirmed by the response of the Ukrainian Geological Survey that there were no material deviations from the statutory procedure in license awards in 2022."

In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG noted that information on the legal framework at both the national and provincial levels is available on the Federal Mining Information System (SIFIM) website, providing relevant links. The MSG’s comments highlight an ongoing survey by the Secretariat of Mining (Project PNUD 017/012) of provincial legal frameworks to map licensing and license management procedures in each of the 23 provinces.
With regards to (offshore) oil and gas activities regulated by the Federal Government, EITI reporting provides information on the award of permits and concessions.

A link to the list of bidders for each of the licenses awarded in Round 1 is disclosed online and referenced in EITI reporting. The EITI Report briefly describes the two permits and concessions that were transferred during the reporting period. While Argentina's EITI reporting has described the statutory procedure for awarding permits and concessions in the oil and gas sector, including technical and financial criteria, it has not confirmed whether the transfer of concessions and permits (or participating interests therein) are subject to the same procedures, including the same technical and financial criteria, as those pertaining to the award process. There is no evidence that the MSG has undertaken a review of non-trivial deviations from statutory procedures in permit and concession awards and transfers, nor provided any commentary on the efficiency of licensing and contracting procedures. Industry and government stakeholders confirmed that the technical and financial criteria used during the transfer of permits and concessions are the same used during the award process, although it remains unclear where this is publicly codified."

Albeiti maintains a mining cadastre as well as a bi-annually updated mining license register and hydrocarbons license register. All datapoints required under Requirement 2.3 are disclosed by Albania online and systematically, except for date of license applications for many mining licenses and all oil and gas licenses, though in Albania’s second EITI validation the EITI Board took the view that the lack of publicly accessible dates of application was a marginal issue that did not affect Albania’s progress in meeting the overall objective of transparency in license information. This view is being retained in the current validation as well. It is to be noted that while the dates of expiry of mining and hydrocarbons licenses are not explicitly provided, these can be surmised from the dates of award, and duration of licenses which have been provided in the online license register for the mining and hydrocarbons sectors. In its comments to the draft Validation report, the MSG confirmed this possibility and Albeiti’s intention to provide this data in the future."

The objective of this requirement is to ensure the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects. The Secretariat’s assessment is that the objective has been fulfilled given the comprehensive permit information publicly available through the MTAI register.
Information on permits is systematically disclosed on the MTAI website in open data format (xls), covering both exploration and production permits. The permit register appears to be comprehensive and provides all relevant information required by the EITI Standard in chronological order starting from 2012. Stakeholder consultations confirmed that there are no active permits from before 2012. The latest updates to the register cover eight exploration and 24 production permits.
The 2020-2021 EITI Report covers the comprehensiveness of the license register. Information published on the website fully covers the requirements of EITI (license-holder name, coordinates, dates of application, award and expiry and covered commodities), including the following data categories:
•	Name of the legal entity which has been granted the permit
•	Date of the application submitted for being granted the permit
•	Permit number, date and term of issuance
•	Name of the mine (sector)
•	Coordinates of the end points of the subsoil area
•	Total area of the sector
•	Name of the mineral
•	Amount of depleting mineral reserves provided, basic and accompanying components and their quantity
•	Annual productivity of the mine
•	Number of the subsoil use contract and date of conclusion
•	Number of amendments to subsoil use contracts and date of conclusion
•	Permits renewal numbers, date and renewal period

Government stakeholders consulted confirmed that the permit register includes information about permits held by all entities. No concerns were raised on the information held in the register. Government stakeholders confirmed that the register is updated every three months and any changes are submitted as soon as received. "

Most stakeholders consulted were broadly satisfied with the availability of mining license and contract information. The online mining cadastre is an improvement on previous years. The Secretariat’s view is that the comprehensiveness and reliability of the mining cadastre could be improved, including by following up on audit findings from the Supreme Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes), but that the information listed under Requirement 2.3.b appears to be available for all active extractive licenses.  

The Ministry of Mines and Energy has deployed an online cadastre which provides all information listed under Requirement 2.3.b. Application dates are not part of the license record, although they are listed in the view “Applications” as “Registration date”.83 The availability of the application date in the cadastre is an improvement on the past Validation. Detailed views on the licence (without application date) and list of licences can be downloaded in PDF. Dates of award and expiry are now available for each license on the online mining cadastre84, which is an improvement since the previous Validation. However, the online cadastre is very slow to load data and view individual records. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue that the speed of loading of license data should not affect the assessment of data available on the cadastral portal, which the Secretariat agrees with.  

While there are some minor information gaps in the 2020 EITI Report, including the lack of information on the awarding Decree for one exploration license and missing dates of application for six (out of 128) licenses, the Secretariat’s view is that these are not material gaps. Indeed, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report highlight the publication of the dates of expiry of all 317 mining licenses and authorisations active as of end-2022 on the EITI-BF website, published in July 2023 during the period for MSG comments. 

However, the timeliness of the cadastre is questioned by the Cour des Comptes audit on gold exploration license awards, spot checks and consultations with various stakeholders indicated that at least one mining license owned by Wahgnion Gold Operations, a material company, was missing from the cadastre. However, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report highlight that the Wahgnion license is in fact recorded in the mining cadastre under the code 735.  In addition, of the 683 valid licences listed, 317 have already expired but continue to be marked as “valid”, which appeared to raise questions about the reliability of the information contained in the cadastre. However, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report highlight the dynamic nature of the mining cadastre, which is updated following each new licensing activity, noting for example that there were 697 active mining licenses as of 4 July 2023, compared to the 683 mining licenses noted as active when the draft Validation report was being prepared.  

It was also brought to the attention of the Secretariat that the permits operated by the SEPB were not yet recorded in the cadastre. With its phosphate activity dating from 1978, the SEPB is currently operating without an exploitation permit. The SOE has sustained a dialogue with the EITI and the relevant ministries to formalise its activity, which includes the additions of its permits to the register of licenses. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report explain that SEPB does not feature in the mining cadastre because it does not hold any active production licenses (exploitation permits), but notes that the SOE is in the process of regularising its situation (presumably through the award of a production license), as described in a November 2022 letter published on the EITI-BF website in July 2023 during the period for MSG comments."

The objective of this requirement is to ensure the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects. The Secretariat’s view is that this objective has been fulfilled given the comprehensive license information provided through the new ANM cadastral portal.  

In mining, the cadastral portal was last updated in January 2020 and it is unclear whether there have been transfers since this date that are not contained in the register. While this cadastral portal is still operating and provides information on license-holders, dates of award and expiry, and commodities covered by the mining license, the fact that the cadastral portal is no longer updated makes it unclear if this information is current or if the cadastral portal is missing information on mining licenses more recently awarded (or transferred). 
Furthermore, dates of application were not found in any mining portal, nor were coordinates of mining areas, though the geographic visualizer shows general areas of operation of major extractive activities that enable the public to see the size and location of license areas. In oil and gas, the license register takes the form of a PDF document with a last date of update as 31 December 2022. License-holder names as well as names of partners and their specific participating interest are listed for each license. Oil and gas license coordinates can be found through the Geographic Visualizer hosted by the ANH. ANH webpages document the various bid rounds for oil and gas licenses and provide dates of application, award and expiry as well as bidder information. Commodities covered by licenses are defined in the license text, which is publicly accessible for all licenses. 

EITI reporting was not used to address gaps in the mining cadastre or to distinguish the year in which mining licenses were awarded. While the EITI Colombia webpage on contracts and licenses provides an assessment of all active mining licenses as of 2021, without distinguishing the year of award, it is not possible to consider that the mining cadastre is up to date. There is no comment in the 2020 EITI Report as to the frequency of update of this mining license register. However, in their comments on the draft Validation report, the MSG, government and EITI Colombia Secretariat highlighted that the new ANM cadastral portal contained all information listed under Requirement 2.3.b for all active mining licenses, confirming that the EITI Colombia Secretariat had reviewed all active licenses in preparing comments on the draft assessment. Thus, the Secretariat is satisfied that the new ANM cadastral portal is now regularly updated and provides the required information on all active mining licenses. The availability of all required license information is also supported by the findings that all mining licenses and contracts have been publicly disclosed in full (see Requirement 2.4).  "

The weaknesses of the two license registers identified during the previous Validation appear to have been addressed. 
EITI Côte d'Ivoire has developed in partnership with the Direction Générale des Hydrocarbures (DGH) an open format cadastre for the oil and gas sector containing all the information for each active license which is regularly updated. This document also contains the history of old licenses. Four (4) application dates are still missing, those corresponding to the former production projects still in operation CI-11, CI-26, CI-27 and CI-40. The stakeholders consulted did not consider this gap to be problematic and felt that the information could easily be added. The commodity produced also appears to be missing but can be deduced from the production figures in the 2019 EITI Report. Regarding the mining sector, the online cadastre appears to contain all active licenses held by material companies in the sector. The names of the holders, contact information, commodity produced, and the dates of application, award, and expiration are comprehensively included."

The Secretariat's view is that the underlying objective of ensuring the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects is only mostly fulfilled due to gaps in the oil and gas contract register, and contradictory and missing data points in the mining cadastre. Consulted government stakeholders agreed with this assessment of the objective given gaps in data and lack of regular update of cadastral information. 

Ecuador's mining license cadastre is administered by the ARCERNNR while the oil and gas contract register is overseen by the Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources. The cadastre and register are publicly accessible, though the oil and gas register is difficult to navigate and it is unclear how often it is updated. 

All data points listed under Requirement 2.3.b other than application date are available in the mining cadastre and from a spot check, it appears that many companies within the agreed scope of EITI implementation are present. However, given comments made by consulted government stakeholders on lack of comprehensiveness and regular update, the International Secretariat agrees that the comprehensiveness of this cadastre cannot be confirmed. Likewise, questions remain as to the veracity of the data points present in the register given irregularities in the classification of concessions as small or large-scale based on the size of the concession. It is also unclear whether all mining agreements entered into by ENAMI and international partners and foreign SOEs are included in the mining cadastre, though ENAMI independently publishes this information.  

In the hydrocarbon register, there is an interactive portal that may contain required datapoints listed under Requirement 2.3.b as there is an option to view active oil blocks. Further information about these blocks requires registration with the ministry and it is unclear how to register. There is a static version of this oil and gas register that contains information on the contract holder, but other aspects of Requirement 2.3.b such as coordinates, dates of application, award and expiry or commodity are not available. 

It is not clear whether gaps in these data portals have been assessed by the MSG nor if there is a documented plan to strengthen these systems. Multiple international development partners alluded to the fact that the mining cadastre had faced funding and confidentiality concerns in the past that resulted in a former version of the cadastre being shuttered. Considering government comments on the lack of regular update of the current cadastre, the Ecuador EITI should ensure that it remains updated.  "

Stakeholders outside of the MSG noted that they were not yet aware of the central overview of all licenses through D-EITI, and that it was a welcome provision of information to understand who the companies, including smaller ones, are, that own licenses. The Secretariat view is that the underlying objective of ensuring the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects is met.
Germany’s license registers are administered by regional mining authorities. A 2017 amendment to BbergG provides for public access to registry data without proof of legitimate interest. Stakeholders consulted for this Validation view this reform as a major achievement of D-EITI implementation in Germany. 
Disclosure practices vary by region. Some regions maintain online license registers. The D-EITI report refers to the NIBIS portal for Niedersachsen, Bremen, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein as a particularly good example of online disclosure.  Other regions with online registers include Baden-Wuerttemberg, Berlin-Brandenburg, North Rhine-Westfalia and the Saarland. D-EITI reporting provides guidance on how to access registry data for each region. The ease of accessing and navigating online registers varies significantly by region.
While there is no consolidated license register covering all of Germany, D-EITI’s data portal provides a spreadsheet that captures registry data from each region. This spreadsheet appears to comprehensively list all licenses. For most entries the information provided is in line with Requirement 2.3., except for some instances where coordinates are not included and a note explains that this information can only be viewed in the physical registry books. No material licenses are affected by those gaps. The spreadsheet contains a large number of historical licenses where the license holders may in fact no longer be operational. During consultations, government representatives noted that this was due to the licenses in principle still being active and that the mining site has not yet been closed. Elsewhere application dates are missing, either because these are not recorded by the licensing authorities or because they can only be viewed in the physical registry books.  The Secretariat has reviewed the materiality of those licenses and has deemed them immaterial. For licenses granted before BbergG was enacted, there is no expiry date. As a result, these fields are blank in the spreadsheet. In some instances, it can be difficult to identify reporting companies in the registry because of variations in the name of the parent company used in the D-EITI report and the name of the license holder (ExxonMobil versus Mobil Erdgas-Erdöl GmbH; JTSD versus MIBRAG). Region’s column titles also vary, making the data more difficult to collate. "

The objective of this requirement is to ensure the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects. The Secretariat's view is that this objective has been fulfilled given systematic disclosures of information in the mining and petroleum registers. While coordinates associated with petroleum licenses are not available in the petroleum register, these are available via the published petroleum agreements. 
In mining, the register contains licenses awarded as of December 2023, which indicates that this register is regularly updated. Of the total 2,072 active licenses the EITI Report (addendum) states that 1,032 licenses were awarded in 2020 alone. The register provides information on license holders, dates of application, award and expiry, and commodities covered by each mining license, including if the license permits the exploitation of more than one type of commodity. Coordinates of mining licenses are provided as well as the size and location of the license area that can be viewed in the map view. The license information is downloadable in open format. The MSG is encouraged to explore if license transfers can be shown as part of the register, in order to address the question on transfers noted in Requirement 2.2.
In oil and gas, the license register contains all active licenses, which take the form of petroleum agreements (PAs). There are seven active PAs in Ghana at the moment, which are all included in the scope of EITI reporting. The register provides information on dates of application, award and expiry, and commodities covered by each PA. The website of the Ghana Petroleum Register explains that all PAs are awarded through publicly disclosed bid rounds and discusses plans for future bid rounds. Coordinates of PAs are not included in the petroleum register but are included in the publicly accessible petroleum agreements themselves. In the petroleum register, the license area is described and can be viewed on the map. It is not clear whether there are plans to include PA license coordinates in the actual petroleum register."

There have been efforts to advance on public registers for mining and coal licenses as well as oil and gas permits, through systematic disclosures in government portals, such as the MEMR Geoportal and the MODI (Minerba) portal. Further efforts have been made to establish comprehensive registers through the EITI Data Portal, in line with the partial mainstreaming work plan. The EITI Data Portal provides information that can be bulk downloaded for all licenses, irrespective of materiality, and includes all details required by the EITI Standard, bar application dates. The MSG clarified in its feedback on the draft Validation report that oil, gas and mining licenses are awarded through an auction process. As a result, information of start date of the auction process is interpreted as the date of application. Considering this clarification, the Secretariat’s view is that the current disclosures fully meet the objective of this requirement to ensure the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects.
Registers for mining and coal licenses as well as oil and gas permits are available on the EITI Data Portal, including the identifier of the license, name of the license holder, commodity, license type, start and end date of contract, province, city, and geomultipolygon reference. The MEMR Geoportal also discloses this information systematically for oil and gas. The MODI (Minerba) portal contains aggregated figures as well as information per individual license holder. A map with coordinates is available in the MEMR Geoportal for oil and gas. Information can be downloaded in bulk and includes the geomultipolygon for each license when exporting the data from the EITI Data Portal. Award and expiry dates are available; however, application dates are not published. 
Active licenses in the EITI Data Portal for all years (excluding 2022 and 2023) amount to 5230, whereas the EITI Report states 5391. The MODI (Minerba) portal states there were 5483 active licenses as of 31 December 2021. There are 324 active oil and gas licenses in the EITI Data Portal (excluding 2022 and 2023). The EITI Report only contains active licenses for 2020 (184) and 2021 (173). Stakeholders have confirmed that information on licenses is disclosed also for entities not covered by the EITI reporting process. On balance, this assessment considers that despite the noted gaps, the level of publicly disclosed information could be considered sufficient to mostly fulfil the objectives of the requirement. 
In their comments on the Validation report, the MSG clarified that the registration dates of mining, oil and gas auctions is interpreted as the date of license application, because new licenses in both sectors can only be obtained through an auction process. The clarification included links to the MEMR  oil and gas and mining working area e-auctions platforms which provide information about the recent e-tendering schedules, including the auction start date. The IEITI data portal includes the start date for the 2nd oil and gas auction round in 2021 (29/11/21) but not for the 1st oil and gas auction round. Also, there is no information on the mining and coal auction rounds on the IEITI data portal, based on which the start date can be induced. Given that auction rounds are publicly announced, this assessment does not consider the limited disclosures on the IEITI portal a material gap. In the light of this new information, the Secretariat’s view is that the current disclosures fully meets the objective of requirement 2.3. on license register."

The previous Validation had not considered the lack of online publication of dates of application for extractive licenses to constitute a gap given that these were considered available upon request in person. Government officials consulted confirmed that dates of application for all licenses were available from the Ministry of Mining and explained that upgrades to the Ministry’s cadastral portal were underway to ensure disclosure of this additional data for all licenses and to extend the cadastral portal to oil and gas.

Indeed, the coverage of 34,757 mining licenses and concessions in the CartoMinMex portal appears to cover all active mining licenses, irrespective of the materiality of payments associated with each license. While the date of award for Pemex’s entitlements is not explicitly provided on the Asignaciones, stakeholder consultations clarified that all such awards took place on 13 August 2014 through Round 0. The date on which Pemex requested all of these entitlements was 21 March 2014, as confirmed in a press release published on the Ministry of Energy website and in the full text of the entitlements.

There are two main sources of mining, oil and gas cadastral data in Mongolia, drawing from the same source but with varying levels of data disclosures. The regulator MRPAM operates the main cadastral portal, from which other organisations source data. It provides all information on extractive licenses as per Requirement 2.3.b aside from date of application, date of award and expiry. The EITI Mongolia open data portal pulls cadastral data from MRPAM but discloses additionally dates of award and expiry for each license. While dates of application do not appear to be disclosed for older minerals and mining licenses, MMRPAM’s statistical bulletins provide updates on license applications and awards on a monthly basis. Government officials consulted explained that the cost of contracting the original vendor to upgrade the MRPAM cadastral portal with dates of application, award and expiry was prohibitive, but that the EITI Mongolia portal disclosed the dates of award and expiry. The Secretariat’s view is that the lack of dates of application for older mining licenses does not constitute a material gap. "

Most stakeholders consulted conceded that the objective of easily accessible licensing information was not yet fulfilled, pending ongoing efforts to modernise the oil and gas cadastral management system through implementation of the PIA. The Secretariat’s view is that, despite the availability of most required information in mining, the objective of transparency in property rights in the oil and gas sector is still far from being achieved. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue for an upgrade in the assessment of Requirement 2.3 to ‘mostly met’.  

In mining, there are three registers that provide public access to mining license information. All together, these registers appear to provide a comprehensive list of types of mining licenses active in the mining sector as well as information on expired licenses and licenses outside of the period under review and irrespective of the materiality of payments to government associated with each license. While most information listed under Requirement 2.3.b is publicly accessible, there are some gaps in information such as date of application and date of award. A government official consulted explained that the MCO’s new cadastral portal based on the EMC+ software had recently been launched in November 2022, but that the migration of data from the old platform to the new cadastral management system was still ongoing. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report note that the three mining license registers provide most information mandated by Requirement 2.3.b and explained that the gaps in disclosures of dates of application and dates of expiry for certain licenses is due to the MCO’s migration to a new portal. While the NSWG comments note that the missing information is available from the MCO upon request, NEITI could have sourced this missing information in order to republish it on the NEITI website as an interim measure to improve public accessibility.  

In oil and gas, Appendix 4 to the 2020 NEITI Report provides basic information on the 61 Oil Prospecting Licenses (OPL) and 109 Oil Mining Licenses (OML) active in 2020, including information listed in Requirement 2.3.b aside from dates of application and coordinates of any licenses, and of dates of expiry and precise dates (beyond the general year) of award for OPLs. Appendix 8 to the 2020 NEITI Report does not provide this missing information, despite the NEITI Transparency template indicating that it does. The former DPR’s 2018 Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Annual Report (NOGIAR) is referenced in the NEITI Transparency template, but the annual report does not provide information updated subsequent to 2018 and provides dates of award and expiry for some, but not all, active licenses (and it only provides the general location name, but not license coordinates). While the (third-party) Oil Spill Monitor and the Gas Flare Tracker websites provide general map user interfaces, they do not map all active oil and gas OPLs and OMLs, clearly indicating the coordinates of each license.   

Secretariat staff consulted explained that the DPR had disclosed license coordinates for the previous Validation in 2018, but that those had been provisional pending the ‘harmonisation’ of license coordinates. However, by 2021 the DPR claimed to have only harmonised coordinates for ten licenses. Government officials consulted highlighted the planned launch of a new online oil and gas cadastral portal in mid 2023, as required by the PIA. While the NUPRC website publishes, in a convoluted way2, license data, this covers license-holder name and dates of award and expiry, but not dates of application or license coordinates. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report explains that the former DPR had explained that the coordinates data was “not of the best quality”, explanations that were published on the NEITI website. The comments also highlight NEITI’s work with the former DPR and now NUPRC to ensure that an electronic license register is published on the NUPRC website in future. Given NEITI’s expectation that all license data listed in Requirement 2.3.b will be publicly disclosed by the relevant government entities by the end of the second quarter of 2023, the NSWG argues for an upgrade in the assessment to ‘mostly met’. However, coordinates of oil and gas licenses do not currently appear to be available upon request from the NUPRC. Thus, pending the public disclosure of the required license data by the relevant government entities planned for later in 2023, the Secretariat’s assessment remains that Requirement 2.3 is partly met.

The requirement is considered exceeded because the data is updated in real time and the register allows data to be downloaded in different formats.  

The petroleum register provides information on license holders, their participating interest (and historical changes thereof), coordinates, date of award, and duration of the license. For the licences that are in production phase, the name of the commodity extracted is not noted in the record (see example). For licences in the production phase, the commodity produced is not listed in the licence, but with the volume over years on the level of the field. The register allows the viewing of license data per individual license, per business arrangements, field, discovery, and company. Supplemental data is available on other categories.  

The comprehensiveness of the register is ensured by Ministry oversight and public access to real time information,  as well as regular audits, monitoring, and ad hoc targeted reviews by the State Audit Institution (Riksrevisjonen).  "

The objective of this requirement is to ensure the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects. Consulted stakeholders commended progress in establishing a digital cadastre for oil and gas licenses but noted that progress was still partial.
This objective is achieved for the mining sector, through the MRA’s mining cadastre, which includes names, application, award and expiry dates, and coordinates of mining tenements, and this does not include an overview of past tenements that are no longer active.    
This objective is far from achieved for the oil and gas sector, as licenses are only made available on the DPE website for the 2019 fiscal year, are only available through separate pdf documents, and lack information on coordinates, size, or location of licensed areas (see https://petroleum.gov.pg/dpe-eiti/). However, the availability of partial information online represents an improvement in the period under review.

The MSG’s ‘Transparency’ template considers the objective of transparency in extractives property rights to be fulfilled, as did consulted government stakeholders. The International Secretariat considers that the objective is mostly fulfilled as expiration dates are not included in the oil and gas register. Likewise, license duration in the mining sector could be more clearly explained. In the MSG’s comments to the draft Validation report, stakeholders committed to including more information on license and contract duration and expiry.
In the mining sector, the System for Mining Rights and Cadastre (SIDEMCAT) and the Mining Cadastre Map (GEOCATMIN) both serve as systematic disclosure points for information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects. It appears that this cadastre and map cover all active licenses and contracts, including those held by material companies and those classified as artisanal and small-scale. Successive EITI Reports have also included much of the required information on active licenses and mining contracts in annex for ease of reference, which summarises annual MINEM publications of exploration and mining investment projects. Information regarding the name of license holders, license coordinates date of application, award, duration and commodity produced are available through these sources and in the linked full text of mining licenses. In terms of duration, Article 10 of the Mining Law notes that mining concessions are granted in perpetuity as long as the concessionaire continues to fulfil all obligations, namely the payment of derecho de vigencia. Monitoring of derecho de vigencia payments is publicly accessible, as is a list of cancelled licenses due to non-payment. In the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation Report, Peru MSG confirmed the International Secretariat’s understanding and added that concessionaires are also required to demonstrate continued minimum production at the concession. Lack of fulfilment of these aspects could lead to state-imposed penalties, and in severe cases, the rescission of the concession.
In the oil and gas sector, Perupetro hosts an online viewing platform that is complimented by the SOE’s up to date list of contracts by lot. Combined, these two sources provide information on all active oil and gas contract holders, including those considered material and included in the scope of the 2021-2022 EITI Report. License holder names are listed, including share of participating interest, and license coordinates are found in the full text of each contract. Date of application and award are clear for contracts listed and EITI reporting provides expiration dates for all production contracts. For the five contracts in exploration phase, however, expiration dates are not clearly indicated. The commodity associated with each oil and gas production contract can be found in the full text of these contracts, but EITI reporting could include additional information on commodity for each contract."

It is unclear whether the 6th PH-EITI Report lists all licenses and contracts held by material companies, or only those that gave rise to material payments to government in 2018 (i.e. producing licenses and contracts). While some of the information listed under Requirement 2.3.b is accessible for the mining, oil and gas licenses, there are significant gaps in dates of application, coordinates and commodity(ies) covered. In its comments, the MSG referenced the new publication of Contracts of Coal and oil and gas Service Contracts through the PH-EITI Contracts portal, albeit with gaps in dates of application and coordinates. While the DOE’s question about the relevance of dates of application is noted, the lack of coordinates is a broader concern, notwithstanding the West Philippine Sea contracts whose coordinates remain confidential for national security considerations. The lack of publicly accessible cadastral portals with key data such as coordinates constitutes a significant gap. The Philippines is therefore far from the objective of ensuring the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects."

The National Minerals Agency hosts, and the Mining Cadastre Office manages the MCAS portal that covers all active mining licenses. The mining license registry appears to list all active mining licenses and upon review of artisanal, small-scale and large-scale licenses, coordinates, dates of application, award and expiry, and commodities are all comprehensively listed. The prior Validation of Sierra Leone noted that artisanal mining licenses were not covered in the MCAS portal, so the addition of these licenses is a clear improvement from the prior assessment. The MCAS portal exceeds the mandate of the 2019 EITI Standard through the documentation of some shareholding interests of companies awarded licenses, though this information is not complete. In the oil and gas sector, a publicly available license register does not exist but given that there were no active oil and gas licenses in the period under review, this does not impact the assessment of Requirement 2.3. The SLEITI MSG notes that a register exists in hard copy at the Petroleum Directorate and individuals must be physically present and can only request information about particular licenses as opposed to being able to view a comprehensive list in either list or map form. Furthermore, inquiring about individual oil and gas licenses requires the payment of a fee. Given the lack of oil and gas licenses in the period under review, the above aspects of the oil and gas register do not represent material gaps."

Stakeholders consulted did not express particular views on progress towards the objective of transparency in extractive property rights. The Secretariat considers that this objective is mostly fulfilled given the lack of progress in improving the accessibility of license data since the previous Validation and the continued lack of public disclosure of dates of application for some contracts in the oil and gas sector.  

The government does not maintain publicly accessible license registers or cadastral portals in either the oil and gas or the mining sector, however, some information is available through various pages on the ANPM website. This affects efficient access to information which impacts the assessment of whether the overall objective of the requirement has been met. The 2019 EITI Report provides a full list of all 12 active oil and gas PSCs, which cover all active licenses in the country, but provides all required information aside from the dates of expiry for certain PSCs and the dates of application and coordinates for all active petroleum rights. Nonetheless, the dates of expiry and coordinates of oil and gas licenses are available on the ANPM website. The 2019 EITI Report provides a list of mining licenses categorised by their year of award, but provides only the name of the license, name of licenseholder and year of license award, but not the other information listed under Requirement 2.3.b. However, no mining company was considered material in the 2019 EITI Report. The ANPM website provides map user interfaces where licenses awarded between 2006 and 2019 are visible and which provides the coordinates of these licenses, although government officials confirmed that this webpage was not regularly updated. A government official consulted explained that ANPM was planning reforms to ensure that comprehensive updated license information was available from the ANPM website in future. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG provided a link to a published oil and gas PSC related to a block in the Joint Development Zone, which provides the geographic coordinates of the contract area as well as the date of contract expiry. However, this information does not appear to be publicly accessible for all active extractive contracts and licenses, nor for all licenses and contracts held by material extractive companies. Indeed, while the ANPM website has recently published the full text of a larger number of active licenses and contracts, which provide dates of expiry and geographic coordinates, the Secretariat’s understanding is that several older (yet active) oil and gas contracts have not yet been disclosed, which are held by material companies included in the scope of TLEITI reporting.

Stakeholders did not express any concern around potential transparency gaps in this area. The International Secretariat considers that despite the implementation of this requirement being severely impacted by martial law, the objective of ensuring the public accessibility of comprehensive information on property rights related to extractive deposits and projects is fully met, as a result of EITI efforts to maintain key data available to the public.
Prior to the imposition of martial law in 2022, public access to information on extractive sector licenses was provided through the Geoinform online register. According to the EITI Report, this register allowed searches of valid, invalid and suspended licenses and covered all information required by the EITI Standard. The portal also included scanned copies of licenses together with agreements on the conditions of subsoil use and work programmes. Some license information was also captured on other government websites, including the Derzhgeonadra website, State Geological Portal, Public Cadastral Map, Unified State Open Data Portal and EITI portal. 
In 2023, the government introduced plans to develop a Unified Geoinformation System to consolidate various online resources, which was launched in April 2025, although not available to the public.
The implementation of this requirement was severely impacted by martial law due to access restrictions on various government portals. As of November 2024, access to most license information and online registers remained limited to government officials involved in the review and approval of license applications.  However, in an effort to reopen information on licenses issued during 2022, the full list of licenses and agreement on the conditions of subsoil use is available on the EITI Portal. This resource includes the name of the license holder, the commodity produced, the date of application, expiry and award date, as well as the beneficial owner, but not the coordinates. In its response to the draft Validation Report, the MSG noted that stakeholders may submit a request for accessing the coordinates with the instructions published on the State Service of Geology and Subsoil website.
Stakeholders were of the view that the restrictions on license information were proportionate considering the war. Given that the Russian military was targeting industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, stakeholders felt that removing access to license coordinates and maps was critical for national security purposes. However, civil society stakeholders also stressed that it was important to continue to collect data and to ensure disclosure retrospectively once the security situation allows."

Argentina EITI has listed and described the contracts and licenses found in the offshore oil and gas sector but has not documented a clear government policy on the disclosure of these contracts and licenses at the federal level or for the extractive sector as a whole. EITI reporting provides a list of all active offshore contracts and licenses in the federally-administered offshore oil and gas sector (albeit without listing the related annexes, amendments and riders where applicable), with the full text of the government decrees, administrative decisions, and resolutions awarding these exploitation concessions and exploration permits. However, the full text of contracts is not annexed to the government decrees and decisions. Stakeholder opinions differed on the public accessibility of the full text of contracts. Industry stakeholders consulted noted that all oil and gas contracts were public documents that should be published in Argentina, even if the government had not yet published all contracts online. Government officials consulted stated categorically that oil and gas contracts were not public documents. Argentina EITI has not published any description of legal barriers to contract disclosure, nor formulated any plans to overcome such barriers if applicable. There is no evidence that the MSG has yet reviewed the public accessibility of extractive contracts and licenses administered by subnational governments based on a review of public sources of information. It is unclear from public documents whether any new oil and gas concessions or permits have been awarded or amended since the start of 2021, though the MSG has indicated that the only bidding round within the scope of Validation would be the Round 1 process that began in 2018 and concluded in 2019.
In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG provides an extensive description of the availability of information on licenses and contracts at both federal and provincial level, including administrative documents awarding the contracts. However, the MSG’s comments note that there are no provisions in the Mining Code or Hydrocarbons Code related to the public disclosure of the full text of contracts and licenses, and thus explain that only provincial administrative instruments and national decrees granting concessions are published in the official gazettes. The MSG’s comments provide a full list of all active oil and gas licenses and concessions and highlight that a large amount of information on permits, licenses and contracts is accessible in the public domain, even if the full text of the licenses and contracts are not yet published.
The MSG’s comments note that the full text of licenses and contracts is available upon request in line with provisions of the Law on the Right of Access to Public Information (Law 27.275) and that the National Secretariat of Energy and the National Secretariat of Mining effectively comply with these legal provisions. Finally, the MSG’s comments highlighted the EITI’s ongoing review of contract transparency in Latin America and noted that the MSG would discuss the findings of the EITI’s report on contract transparency in Latin America to plan appropriate follow-up measures. The International Secretariat welcomes the significance of these plans but notes that significant aspects of Requirement 2.4 remain to be addressed in the period under review in this Validation."

Significant aspects of the requirement have not yet been addressed: It remains unclear whether the full texts of all licenses, concessions and contracts awarded in 2021 are publicly disclosed. There is currently no clear government policy, though the MSG appear to deem the legal framework and practice conducive for comprehensive disclosure of the contents of future or current licenses and contracts. It appears that general practice is to (at least partially) publish production sharing agreements (PSAs) through the Official Gazette and mining licenses issued through the National Business Registry (QKB). Albeiti also appears to collate the most complete list of licenses that exists in Albania, but does not indicate what documents would constitute a comprehensive disclosure of appendixes, addendum or riders of a concession, contract or license. While Albanian stakeholders confirm their intention to publicly disclose the contents of concessions, contracts and licenses entered or amended from 1 January 2021, it still remains unclear (i) what the MSG considers as ""the full text of different licenses, concessions and contracts, including any of their appendixes, addendum or riders"", and (ii) whether Albeiti maintains a list of licenses, contracts or concessions that are publicly accessible at present. While MSG comments to the draft Validation report identified several companies that were awarded mining permits in 2021, the comments did not appear to address the two issues highlighted above. While Albeiti appears to maintain lists of active licenses and contracts, they do not appear to provide references to whether or (precisely) where the full text of these documents can be accessed, covering both the body of the contract and license as well as any annexes, amendments and riders where applicable.

Armenia was assessed as having made satisfactory progress in the previous Validation. The objective of this requirement is to ensure the public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities (at least from 2021 onwards) as a basis for the public’s understanding of the contractual rights and obligations of companies operating in the country’s extractive industries. Based on stakeholder consultations and available documents, the Secretariat considers that the objective has been fulfilled.
The government policy is in favour of contract and license disclosure. Law No. HO-191-N “On Making Changes and Amendments to the Code on Subsoil” adopted in March 2018 states that the authorised body shall publish on its official website the subsoil use contracts and amendments with subsoil users extracting minerals. This policy covers extractive rights in both the metallic and non-metallic mining sectors. Full text of laws and regulations can be found on ARLIS.
All production contracts are provided in Armenian and are available in PDF format. The link on open mining contracts available on the Armenia EITI website also provides access to all contracts for metallic and non-metallic minerals, including terminated permits, published on the MTAI website. According to government representatives, all annexes and amendments were disclosed. Information on permits is systematically disclosed on the website of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure (MTAI) in open data format (xls). 
According to the 2020-2021 Armenia EITI Report, some changes to the contracts were made in the fiscal years under review. These changes are comprehensively described in EITI reporting and are disclosed on the MTAI website. Additionally, the report provides an overview of the availability of annexes on companies’ social obligations (see Requirement 6.1).   
No concerns regarding the comprehensiveness of information available on the MTAI website related to contract disclosure were expressed by any of the stakeholders consulted. Stakeholders from civil society consider contract transparency to be an important achievement, and highlighted the importance of disclosure in order to ensure companies adhere to their responsibilities. Civil society stakeholders stated that substantial efforts have been made to disseminate this information and to ensure communities can also make use of it. A case was raised whereby a contract included a company’s social responsibility provision that did not correspond with the needs of the community, subsequently leading to a contract amendment. This underscores the importance of this information being publicly available."

Many contracts, including pre-dating 1 January 2021, and all licenses seem to be published according to the law, which explicitly mandates the publication of licenses and contracts. Burkina Faso did not maintain an overview of all active contracts during the period reviewed by the draft Validation report, but the MSG published a list of active licenses and contracts at end 2022 during the period for comments on the draft Validation report. However, the Secretariat's document review indicates that not all contracts since 1 January 2021 appear to have been published yet.  

Article 15 of the 2015 Mining Code explicitly mandates the publication of all mining licences and contracts via the official gazette (Journal official). As the gazette is not available electronically70 EITI-BF has published licences and contracts on the EITI national website.71 A sample check showed that the full text of some licences that were allocated in December 2022 and January 2023 (as listed in the online cadastre) have been published on the Burkina Faso website. All extractives contracts except for one appear to include all annexes (for those checked). Disclosures include contracts and licenses signed before January 2021, dating back to 2003. Most contracts include the licence as annex, but licences are published separately as well on the EITI-BF website. A comparison between the list of active mines published in the statistical bulletin in December 2022 and the list of published contracts on EITI-BF show that 18 contracts of the 27 active mining projects have been published. There is no evidence that the MSG has considered the materiality of exploration licenses, although the Secretariat notes that the government’s disclosure policy covers both exploration and production rights. In its comments on the draft Validation report, the MSG highlighted the publication of the 18 contracts on the EITI-BF website, and noted that all contracts and licenses had been published in the official gazette. While the Secretariat recognises the EITI-BF work in improving access to the 18 key mining contracts, it has also faced challenges in accessing the full text of other mining licenses and contracts published in the official gazette (journal official). 

Several of the mining sites listed as active have expired permits. These could have been renewed, but this is not reflected in the cadastre or the published contract. The 2021 contract disclosure plan72 presents a costing of the activities that led to the disclosure of the full text of licenses and contracts to the EITI-BF website, and the result is a rich compilation of documents. However, the plan does not include a list or an overview of all contract and licenses currently active or identify what amendments have been made to which contracts and licenses. This represents an obstacle to the overall objective of ensuring the public’s understanding of the contractual rights of extractive companies, particularly considering the high amount of awards/cancellation of mining rights in the country.

When consulted, industry and civil society stakeholders considered that the objective of contract transparency had been fulfilled. While Law 1712 of 2014 provides for certain economic rights information contained in documents that are not considered to be part of oil and gas contracts cannot be disclosed by law, as clarified in the government and EITI Colombia Secretariat’s comments on the draft Validation report. The Secretariat’s view is that the objective of Requirement 2.4 is fully met given that all active contracts and licenses appear to have been disclosed. In its comments on the draft Validation report, civil society acknowledged the important advances in contract transparency but highlighted the continued challenges in accessing and understanding contracts by stakeholders at the subnational level. Further improvements in the accessibility of contracts and licenses could help improve their use by a broader range of stakeholders.  

Relevant government policy on contract and license disclosure in the mining and oil and gas sectors is summarized in the 2020 EITI Report and links are provided to where the full text of these laws and regulations can be found on government websites. Government policy is in favour of contract and license disclosure, although there are legal constraints to publicly disclosing economic information that is not considered part of the contract. The redacted information consists of data that, if disclosed, is alleged by government and industry stakeholders to be harmful to natural persons or legal entities and proprietary technical information, such as variables used to calculate the economic contributions of extractive projects. However, this explanation of the rationale for redacting portions of published contracts has not yet been published. In practice, the ANH and ANM provide lists of all active licenses and contracts (including those awarded prior to 1 January 2021), as well as the full text, with annexes, amendments and riders other than what is expressly prohibited. It appears that the Colombian government has made great efforts to publish contracts in the mining sector and the concession contract webpage hosted by the ANM appears to publish the full text of numerous mining contracts. EITI reporting provides figures for each type of active mining contract and license and includes a link to where the text of these contracts and licenses are found on the ANM website. While there is no comprehensive review of which contracts and licenses are published (including annexes, amendments and riders in accordance with Requirement 2.4.c.ii) all contracts and licenses appear to be published on the ANM and ANH websites according to all stakeholders consulted.

Mining contracts and licenses are yet to be published, and some stakeholders considered the lack of publication in the mining sector as problematic. The 2019 EITI Report provides an overview of the applicable legal framework for extractive contract and license disclosure. The legal framework largely supports public dissemination of the contents of licenses and contracts. Hence, there do not appear to be explicit legal barriers to contract transparency. Given that extractive contracts are awarded by laws and extractive licenses awarded by decree, the publication of the full text of these documents is required in the official gazette (journal officiel). After the start of the Validation, in November 2022, the seven oil and gas contracts signed between January 2019 and July 2022 have been made public through a special edition. It includes the full text of the contract, as well as amendments and annexes. This publication has been unanimously welcomed by stakeholders engaged in the extractive sector. Several others production sharing contracts are also available through the national EITI website. However, in the absence of a comprehensive review of all active contracts and licenses with references to where each license is publicly accessible, it is difficult to conclude whether all documents have been published. An overview or a list of all active contracts and licenses, including exploration contracts, indicating which contracts and licenses are publicly available, and which are not, does not appear to be yet publicly available. In its response to the draft Validation Report, the MSG, confirmed that oil contracts signed since 2019 have been published in the Official Journal and on the national EITI website. In the mining sector, all mining production contracts concluded since 2019 have been transferred to the Secretariat General of the Government for publication, and copies have been published by Côte d’Ivoire EITI . However, these disclosures seem to only include production, not exploration, licenses and contracts."

ac_ei_contracts,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contracts and licenses,Public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities,Americas,Ecuador,ac_ei_03,ECU,1,Partial,Mostly met,"The International Secretariat's assessment is that Requirement 2.4 is mostly met. There is no explicit government policy on contract and license disclosure and disclosure practices do not follow a set procedure, which limits fulfilment of the objective of ensuring the public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities (at least from 2021 onwards) as a basis for the public's understanding of the contractual rights and obligations of companies operating in the country's extractive industries. The Secretariat considers that the objective has been only mostly fulfilled given a lack of clarity and MSG discussion on the government's position on contract transparency and a lack of comprehensive disclosure of all extractive contracts and licenses, despite improving publication practices of petroleum contracts. In their comments to the draft Validation report, government stakeholders considered that there was no need for a specific law on contract transparency given that they considered that mining contracts are published in practice, although it is not clear whether all mining contracts have in fact been published. International development partners agreed with the Secretariat’s assessment that there should be documented MSG discussions on where government policy on contract disclosure is embodied. 

Ecuador EITI has not documented relevant government policy on license and contract disclosure for mining and hydrocarbons and international development stakeholders confirmed that there is not a centralised policy on contract disclosure. It is not clear from EITI reporting where government policy on contract disclosure is embodied given the lack of focused legislation on this matter. While numerous pre- and post-2021 contracts have been disclosed in the hydrocarbons sector, it is not clear where the impetus for this disclosure came from or whether it will continue. International development stakeholders noted that there had been even more pre-1 January 2021 oil and gas contracts that had been disclosed but that they were not migrated to new government websites when these websites were updated, emphasizing the importance of a clear government policy on contract disclosure. Given that the last bid round for oil and gas contracts was in January 2021, there are active contracts that should be disclosed. Ecuador’s EITI reporting notes that there are 38 active oil and gas contracts, yet only ten are disclosed on the government repository. Of the pre-2021 contracts that are publicly disclosed, it appears that this disclosure includes annexes, amendments and riders, but without an inventory of which contracts are published and which are not, comprehensiveness is not able to be determined. While the comprehensiveness of disclosure of post-1 January 2021 contracts is unclear, there are newly awarded and amended contracts that are available to the public on via government publications (scroll down to “Contratos petroleros”). These disclosure practices in the hydrocarbon sector are commendable. Some petroleum contracts entered into and amended before and after 1 January 2021 are disclosed. EITI reporting lists all active petroleum contracts, though this list does not indicate which are publicly available and which are not.  

By contrast, the ARCERNNR hosts a mining register that contains what appears to be a complete list of mining licenses and contracts, although it is the Secretariat's understanding that there is no public disclosure of mining contracts or licenses, including model licenses. During the Validation mission, mining industry stakeholders expressed reservations on full contract disclosure, stating that this information could be misinterpreted or taken out of context to cast mining companies in a bad light. EITI reporting does provide a description of the general criteria applicable to different mining regimes but the mining register’s list does not touch on the public availability of these licenses. Information on large-scale mining projects in which ENAMI is involved can be found via publications on their website. Another recent large-scale mining project spearheaded by SolGold, the Cascabel Project, provides a clear precedent for companies interested in promoting transparency and anti-corruption in their mining projects. Through collaboration with local civil society groups, SolGold’s exploitation contract includes specific clauses that require adherence to the EITI Standard. However, to date, this contract has not been publicly disclosed and Ecuador MSG is invited to comment on when this contract will become publicly available. 

Given the lack of MSG discussion about what constitutes government policy on contract disclosure, and the lack of actual disclosure of mining contracts and licenses, it would be helpful for future discussions to document this policy and then document and explain any deviations from established procedure, with an explanation for why mining contracts and licenses are not disclosed and recommendations to disclose them.

The publication of contracts does not apply in Germany because there is no contracting regime. Nonetheless, the accessibility of licenses and the ability to assess deviations from model terms remains applicable. In several regions legitimate interest must be demonstrated to access licenses. Stakeholders from all constituencies noted that this does not pose a significant impediment to public understanding of the obligations of companies because key information is captured in public license registries. Nonetheless, legitimate interest restrictions mean that the objective of Requirement 2.4 is not yet fully met. 
Germany has a licensing regime for the extractive sector in which regional mining authorities do not negotiate contract terms with companies. Instead, they issue a license document (Erstbescheid) in which project-specific terms, such as the name of the license holder, license coordinates and approval and expiry dates, are documented. This information is then captured in license registries administered by regional mining authorities. All other terms of exploration and extraction are defined in federal legislation and regional regulations. License documents are based on a model license (or document), but the model license is different from region to region.
The MSG concluded that for the period under review, Requirement 2.4 of the EITI Standard is not applicable for D-EITI due to the absence of a contracting regime in the extractive sector. The International Secretariat notes that the requirement equally applies to the disclosure of extractive sector licenses.
According to the federal mining law, license documents do not need to be made publicly available unless the request is made by a person who can prove legitimate interest.  In practice, government approaches to license disclosure vary by region. D-EITI’s reporting portal provides guidance on the disclosure practice of each region. Lower Saxony, Bremen, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein appear to be the only regions which systematically disclose most license documents (with some gaps, particularly in the case of very old licenses).  In all other regions, legitimate interest must be demonstrated in order to gain access to these documents. BbergG does not provide a definition for what constitutes legitimate interest, and the guidance published on the D-EITI website does not explain what would be considered “legitimate interest”. The International Secretariat is not aware of any of these regions publishing a model license document in lieu of actual licenses. 
Stakeholders consulted for this Validation were of the view that the public interest restrictions are not a major impediment for understanding the obligations of companies operating in the extractive sector, as payment obligations are defined in federal and regional legislation, which is systematically disclosed. The government argued that there are no deviations in licenses from the standard clauses, but the International Secretariat is not aware that this was reviewed or assessed. License-specific information, such as license holder and duration, is recorded in the license registries administered by regional mining authorities. This information can also be downloaded from the D-EITI portal (see Requirement 2.3). "
ac_ei_contracts,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Contracts and licenses,Public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities,Africa and the Middle East,Ghana,ac_ei_03,GHA,1,Partial,Mostly met,"The International Secretariat’s initial assessment is that Requirement 2.4 is mostly met. The Secretariat commends Ghana for having published all petroleum contracts and a number of contracts for mining and oil and gas through government websites, predating January 2021. As there have been new mining leases attributed since January 2021, and there may have been amendments to existing agreements, the International Secretariat’s view is that the objective of Requirement 2.4 is mostly met. In particular, for large scale mining operations and Ghana’s producing oil and gas fields, an inventory of which agreements are to be published and where to find them would be necessary to establish the comprehensiveness of disclosures on a rolling basis, in particular given that an agreement for lithium has recently been signed. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue for an upgrade in the assessment of Requirement 2.4 to ‘fully met’. The comments note that the list of active mining licenses is available through the mining cadastral portal, that mining development agreements are published on the Mining Commission’s website, and the fact that all mining licenses are pro forma, with the model license for each license type available on the Mining Commission’s website. However, while the list of active mining licenses provides a list of active licenses, it does not provide an overview of which contracts and licenses are publicly available in accordance with Requirement 2.4.c.ii. The lack of such an inventory of all active extractive licenses and contracts is a concern, since the process of indicating where each document is publicly disclosed and highlighting contracts or licenses that may not have been published yet helps improve the public accessibility of such contracts. 
For mining, several Mining Leases, in total 28, have already been published on the Minerals Commission website, predating 2021. Stakeholders consulted confirmed that there are ongoing efforts to complete the disclosures for mining development and investment agreements to complement the Mining Leases. Since January 2021, 31 new mining leases have been allocated. The inventory of all active licenses and contracts, their status, degree of amendment and place of publication is not yet available, which makes it difficult to ascertain the coverage of contracts and licenses published. Government stakeholders confirmed that, regarding mining licenses, all awarded licenses adhered to the model agreement but noted that the full text of all mining licenses are yet to be listed in the Ghana Mining Repository. Relevant government policy on license and contract disclosure in the mining sector is summarised in the 2020 GHEITI Mining Report. Efforts are underway to amend the Minerals and Mining Act to allow for full contract disclosure, thus it is even more commendable that Ghana has already published many contracts. Consulted national secretariat staff added context to these amendment efforts by noting that even with the passage of an amended Minerals and Mining Act, it will take time to digitise existing licenses and contracts given that most of them are in paper form. The 2020 GHEITI Mining Report indicates that contract disclosure policy is defined through Section 56 of Act 919. During consultations, mining industry stakeholders indicated that they were in favour of full contract disclosure but that efforts on this front must be led by government.
For oil and gas, it appears that all petroleum agreements, including amendments, annexes and riders have been published through the Ghana Petroleum Register and are publicly accessible. To note that the two companies Tullow Ghana Ltd and Kosmos Energy Ghana, which are subsidiaries of EITI supporting companies, have disclosed the contracts on their respective company websites.
In both sectors, agreements are detailed in a map view and it is not clear whether there are regularly updated lists of active mining and petroleum agreements where the public can easily see which agreements are active and publicly accessible, with specific references to each published document and an indication of whether some documents were not publicly accessible. Consulted government stakeholders in mining were unable to confirm that the list provided in the mining repository comprehensive of all active mining exploration and exploitation contracts and licenses.  While the Ghana Mining Register indicates that efforts are ongoing to publish missing mining development and investment agreements, it is not clear if there is an established plan in place to publish these agreements.

The MSG has reviewed Indonesia’s contract disclosure policy and sustained engagement on this issue. However, the disclosure of all licences and contracts in the extractive sector underpinning extractive activities would be needed to meet the objective of the requirement of ensuring public’s understanding of the contractual rights and obligations of extractive companies. 
The government’s contract disclosure policy was thoroughly reviewed in the contract transparency study conducted in 2021, effectively codifying the government’s policy on public disclosure of extractive contracts and licenses. Additionally, previous EITI Reports have also addressed these policies. However, neither contracts nor full license documents are disclosed at present.
The contract transparency study commissioned by the MSG and conducted in 2021 includes a review of actual practice of contract disclosure and is publicly accessible. This can be deemed as an explanation by the MSG for the deviations, where disclosure practice deviates from legislative or government policy requirements concerning the disclosure of contracts and licenses. The study reveals that Indonesia has made strides in disclosing contract and license information through various web-based platforms, including MoDI, MDR 2.0, and the One Map initiative. The establishment of these information systems demonstrates a commitment to systematic disclosure for this EITI Requirement, in line with the partial mainstreaming work plan.
However, the study also highlights significant gaps in the implementation of this EITI Requirement. The contract information in the MoDI and OneMap is very limited, as it only provides three information points contained in contracts, out of over 30 sections and several annexes per contract. In addition, the study confirmed the lack of legal barriers to contract and license disclosure. The study addresses several concerns regarding contract transparency disclosure, particularly focusing on the main legal barriers to disclosure cited by stakeholders: potential infringement of personal information, competitive harm, and the protection of natural resource wealth. The study states that, from a legal perspective, the risk of infringing personal information through the disclosure of contracts and licenses is questionable. Furthermore, a thorough review of the available documents revealed no substantial evidence suggesting that such disclosure would harm personal or proprietary information. Additionally, the study found insufficient evidence to support the notion that disclosing contracts and licenses would result in competitive harm. This finding challenges the argument that transparency in contracts and licenses raises commercial confidentiality concerns. Finally, the argument for withholding information to protect natural resource wealth was also deemed inadequate. The study concluded that, apart from instances where certain resources are legitimately protected for national defence purposes, there is not enough evidence to justify the non-disclosure of contract and license information on the grounds of protecting natural resource wealth. 
The regime for public disclosure in Indonesia requires a consequential harm test to be conducted to determine whether the information can be disclosed to the public. As a result of recommendations from the study, in 2021, the MSG conducted a series of discussions applying the consequential harm test. The MSG confirmed through consultations that certain information within contracts and permits — such as general contract clauses related to definitions, dispute mechanisms, environmental obligations, and financial management - is relatively generic and does not contain sensitive information. Therefore, this information could be disclosed. However, the MSG also determined that this information is not required by the public and, as a result, this information does not need to be disclosed. The EITI Report contains the next steps based on the consequential harm test conducted. The Transparency Template also states that data is in the process of being developed for inclusion in MODI, in line with the action points stated in the latest EITI Report. However, the plans and recommendations outlined in these documents and in the partial mainstreaming work plan have not yet been fully implemented, and as a result, actual contract disclosure has not been achieved.
Concerns have been raised by CSOs regarding contract transparency. CSOs stated that, although the intent was for the EITI to facilitate open discussions on contract transparency, no action had been taken to ensure public disclosure to date. CSOs also highlighted that the responsibility for public disclosure extends beyond the national secretariat to other government entities, making it more challenging for the secretariat to effect change.
The MSG's response to the draft Validation report further emphasises the opinion to keep contracts confidential due to their unique terms and investor privacy concerns. The feedback notes that while these contracts do not contain resource valu information that could affect national energy security, they should be exempt from public disclosure in line with the principle of maintaining the sanity of contracts. The MSG plan to regularly updated on the ESDM Geoportal with certain non-sensitive information to maintain transparency.

Some government officials consulted considered that the objective of public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities had not yet been fulfilled given capacity constraints that had hindered the full publication of all contracts and licenses to date. Several CSOs considered that the objective had not been achieved given concerns over gaps in the comprehensiveness of contract and license disclosures. The Secretariat’s view is that the objective has been mostly fulfilled given gaps in the review of disclosure practices and the lack of disclosure of contracts and licenses awarded or amended since the start of 2021. 
Malawi has used its EITI reporting to clarify the government's policy on contract and license disclosure in the mining, petroleum and forestry sectors, and oil, gas and mining contracts appear to be disclosed on a third-party site (ResourceContracts.org). Malawi’s 2016-18 national action plan for the Open Government Partnership (OGP) included commitments to disclose all extractive contracts, although the level of follow-up on these commitments remains unclear. However, some CSOs considered that there was no mechanism for systematically publishing all extractive contracts and expressed scepticism about whether all mining contracts had yet been published online. Several CSOs noted that mining, oil and gas contracts had been published ahead of the previous Validation, but that no new contracts had been published since then. 
While Malawi EITI has made progress in the public disclosure of the full text of contracts, the progress in disclosure of the full text of licenses has not yet been commensurate with the level of transparency on contracts. The policy and practice related to the publication of the full text of extractive licenses are covered by the government’s general contract disclosure policy, which covers all extractive rights documents. Several CSOs consulted noted that mining exploration and production licenses were meant to be publicly accessible but that this was not the case in practice, with the example of the non-publication of the successor license to Nyala Mining Ltd awarded in 2019 cited as an example. There is no evidence that Malawi EITI has compiled and published a comprehensive list of all active mining, oil and gas licenses and contracts (including annexes, amendments and riders), indicating which have been published, with links to each published document. The MSG has prepared a list of licenses and contracts that have been publicly disclosed, but has not yet published a comprehensive list of active licenses and contracts, clearly identifying the specific licenses and contracts that have not yet been publicly disclosed. Stakeholder consultations indicated that the MSG has reviewed the oil and gas contracts as well as the mining contracts considered the largest in the sector but had not yet reviewed all active contracts and licenses to assess their public availability. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MWEITI MSG notes that the EITI Reports and the Mining Cadastre include information on licenses. However, it is unclear from MWEITI and other public sources whether any new licenses and contracts have been awarded or amended since 1 January 2021 (given that the mining cadastre is not searchable by date of award), or whether the full text of such contracts and licenses are publicly disclosed. Government officials consulted confirmed that around 50 new exploration licenses and ten new production licenses had been awarded since the start of 2021, although the full list of rights awarded since the start of 2021 does not appear publicly accessible, and the full text of these documents has not yet been published. The MSG’s comments on the draft assessment noted ongoing negotiations to conclude a number of Mining Development Agreements (MDAs) and expressed the government’s commitment to publish the full text of such agreements once concluded, but do not comment on the public accessibility of the full text of mining licenses.

Entitlements granted to Pemex have also been disclosed on the Ministry of Energy website. However, all licenses and contracts in the mining sector (particularly those awarded or amended in 2021) have not all been comprehensively disclosed to date and the MSG has not explained the reasons for the lack of comprehensive disclosure of mining contracts and licenses in accordance with government policy.

Most stakeholders consulted agreed that the broader objective of public understanding of the contractual rights and obligations of extractive companies had been mostly fulfilled given the lack of publication of contracts since 2020. While many contracts concluded prior to 2021 have been disclosed, the latest contracts disclosed date to 2019, with several older published contracts missing annexes containing key terms and conditions. It is unclear whether any mining, oil and gas contracts were concluded or amended since 1 January 2021, although there have been hundreds of minerals and mining license awards in that period. None of the full-text of mining exploration and production licenses appear to have been disclosed to date. 
A total of 895 contracts and 162 annotations have been disclosed on the portal, although this includes a range of contractual documents ranging from the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement to local development agreements between extractive companies and local governments and communities. EITI Mongolia has made plans to disclose all contracts, including dedicating Objective 6 of its 2022 work plan to publishing contracts concluded in 2020-22. Mongolia has used its EITI reporting to document the government’s policy on disclosure of contracts that govern the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas and minerals. However, the government’s policy and actual practice of disclosure of the full text of licenses is unclear. Nonetheless, civil society (OSF, PWYP) drove the process of establishing Mongolia’s open contracts portal, which is now operated jointly with EITI Mongolia and MMHI. This has been a significant development in improving the accessibility of key contracts in the mining, oil and gas sectors. While a majority of contracts governing the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas and minerals appear to have been published, there are some notable omissions such as the annexes to production sharing agreements (PSAs) of companies at the production phase (PetroChina and Donsheng) for instance. However, the full text of mining licenses does not appear to be publicly disclosed, with only limited information about the terms of the license available on the MRPAM cadastral portal and the Mongolia Open Data Lab portal rather than the full text of the mining license. There does not appear to have been a systematic review (by EITI Mongolia or other stakeholder) of all active licenses and contracts in the mining, oil and gas sectors, including any annexes, amendments and riders, indicating which have been published and which have not. While EITI Mongolia has not published any explanation for the deviation between government policy and practice related to contract disclosure nor documented any legal or regulatory barriers to doing so, stakeholder consultations indicated that there are no legal barriers to disclosure of all contractual documents. In its comments on the draft assessment, the EITI Mongolia Secretariat noted that licenses and contracts would be publicly disclosed when awarded or concluded in accordance with provisions of the new law on public accessibility of data, implemented since May 2022. It highlighted the value of the Open Contracts website and the MRPAM cadastral portal. "

Opinions of stakeholders consulted were split over progress towards the objective of public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities. While several government officials consulted considered that Nigeria was close to the objective, highlighting that Nigeria was currently chairing the EITI’s Global Contract Transparency Network as a reflection of the government’s commitment in this area, several civil society representatives considered that Nigeria was still far from the objective of contract transparency. Industry representatives simply noted their general support for this work but that it was a low priority for oil and gas companies, and that there were commercial confidentiality concerns in some parts of the contracts. Some development partners expressed significant concern over the lack of award of contracts by competitive bidding and the lack of awareness about the terms of contracts among host communities. The Secretariat’s view is that the objective is still far from being fulfilled given the lack of disclosure of all contracts and licenses awarded since January 2021, combined with a lack of public review of the public availability of all contracts, including those pre-dating 2021 and covering amendments and riders. There remains a general lack of clarity over how many times specific oil and gas contracts have been amended. The NSWG’s comments argue for an upgrade in the assessment of Requirement 2.4 to ‘mostly met’, based on its perception that most technical aspects of the requirement have been addressed. The NSWG considers that the significant progress in contract transparency achieved in 2022 should be better acknowledged, given the low starting point for contract disclosure prior to 2022.  

The Federal Government of Nigeria has committed to contract disclosure as part of its commitments in the (second) 2019-2023 OGP National Action Plan, as codified in its Open Contracting Disclosure Guidelines. The 2021 Petroleum Industry Act (Article 83.5) explicitly states that oil and gas licenses and contracts are not confidential and should be published on the NUPRC website immediately following the granting or signing of the text. The Federal Government has established a nine-member Committee on contract disclosure that included NEITI, NNPC, the Federal Ministry of Finance, NUPRC, the Office of Attorney General and others.  

In mining, Nigeria EITI has provided an overview of government commitments to contract transparency through the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and the 2011 FOI Act but there is no explicit policy endorsing the full disclosure of mineral licenses that grant exploration and exploitation rights. It appears that there has been progress in the period under review to disclose all post-1 January 2021 Community Development Agreements (CDA) that must be signed when an exploitation license is awarded, but these contracts do not contain exploration and exploitation rights. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report argued that the lack of a Federal Government policy on the disclosure of the full text of mining contracts and licenses has not hindered the publication of the full text of all active Community Development Agreements (CDAs) in the mining sector. There appears to be a comprehensive list of all active mining licenses, but neither the full text of mining licenses nor the model license templates appear to be publicly available. There is no public explanation by NEITI confirming whether all mining licenses are pro forma, based on a review of all active mining licenses. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report states that all mining contracts awarded or amended in the period January 2021 – July 2022 have been comprehensively published, although it is unclear whether any mining contracts were awarded or amended since July 2022, and why these have not yet been publicly disclosed. The status of publication of the full text of mining licenses is unclear from the NSWG’s comments. The comments also highlight the mining regulator’s commitment to provide copies of other mining contracts to NEITI for public disclosure in future.  

In oil and gas, only a small minority of contracts and licenses have been disclosed and most oil and gas rights awarded and amended since January 2021 have not been published in full. There have been many awards of new oil and gas licenses since 2021, including through the marginal fields round that concluded in 2022. The NNPC website publishes a handful of oil and gas contracts (awarded between January 2021 and the enactment of the PIA in August 2021), gas development agreements and oil sales agreement templates. The (third-party) ResourceContracts portal publishes only eight Nigerian oil and gas contracts, although government officials consulted noted that these were not contracts that had been published by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The 2020 NEITI Report states that no oil and gas contracts or licenses have been published in the period under review. While NEITI has published a list of 61 Oil Prospecting Licenses (OPL) and 109 Oil Mining Licenses (OML) active in 2020, this list does not include annexes, amendments or riders where relevant, nor indicate which contract and license documents have been published (and guidance on where to access them) and which have not. Government stakeholders consulted explained that NEITI was proceeding in a phased approach towards contract transparency, first focusing on the disclosure of contracts awarded between 1 January 2021 and the enactment of the PIA, as it was assumed that all contracts and licenses awarded from August 2021 onwards would soon be published on the NUPRC website in accordance with the Act. It was confirmed that NEITI had collected all contracts awarded and amended between January and August 2021, but that these had not yet been published. Government officials confirmed that NNPC was planning to publish all contracts and amendments since January 2021 and that the NUPRC planned to publish all new oil and gas contracts awarded under the PIA in the second quarter of 2023. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report states that all oil and gas contracts awarded or amended in the period January – August 2021 have been comprehensively published, although it is unclear whether publication of all oil and gas contracts awarded or amended since August 2021 in accordance with the PIA has yet taken place. The comments also highlight the NUPR’'s commitment to publish all oil and gas contracts awarded or amended after August 2021 in future as mandated by the PIA. 

EITI reporting and additional NSWG documents provide a published plan for overcoming barriers to comprehensive disclosure, but these plans appear to still be in their infancy. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report emphasise that NEITI has published a plan for comprehensive contract disclosure, which articulates the activities to be carried out, responsible entities and timelines. The comments argue that the plan has been substantively implemented and rejected the notion that implementation of the contract disclosure plan was still in its infancy. For instance, in November 2022 the NSWG carried out a review of contract disclosure practices that led to an update in the contract disclosure plan and activities. The comments concluded that there was no need for NEITI to develop a plan to overcome legal barriers to contract disclosure because no such barriers were considered to exist.  

Government stakeholders consulted noted that NEITI was struggling to rebuild a list of all active contracts and licenses that also tracked when each contract had been amended. NEITI was drawing information from NUPRC and NNPC to rebuild a picture of contract amendments but knew that it did not yet have a complete picture of all contract amendments. Industry representatives consulted stated that it was up to each oil and gas company’s discretion whether to publish their operating contract.  "

Stakeholder consultations and available documentation confirm the availability of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities as. The requirement is exceeded because the information on licences and contracts is available free of charge, and key variables of the licences are summarised with the announcement of the license attribution. 

Norway operates a licensing regime in which petroleum licenses are based on model licenses (one for mature and one for frontier areas) and model contract. License awards are followed by a standard agreement between government and operators. This agreement is composed of a main agreement and two annexes, including a joint operating agreement and an accounting agreement. These are based on one of two model contracts, depending on whether the agreement includes state participation. The model licences and contracts are available on the government and the ministry websites.

Licences allocated through licencing rounds are based on the model template. Variable factors relate to the work programme and are systematically disclosed in an excel file summarising the key licence information (parties that hold interest in the licence, their participating interest and details on the work programme). Actual licences and their associated contracts (including the two annexes) are available upon request through einnsyn, a governmental access to information platform, to which the NPD responds by email.  In practice, all licences and associated contracts can be requested. Any changes in the work programme are recorded as part of the licence register, provides an overview of amendments or relinquishments, and whose comprehensiveness and accessibility were confirmed during this Validation.   Contracts from the 2019 TFO round (where the licenses were allocated in the 2020 year under review) can be found in one collection as described above.  "

This requirement is intended to ensure the public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities, and Phase 1 disclosures outlined in the Requirement apply to the period under review for this Validation. 
There have been some indications of government interest in contract transparency, including a 2017 letter from the Deputy Prime Minister suggesting that relevant ministers had been instructed to disclose Memorandum of Agreements, and a 2019 letter from the formal Acting State Solicitor advising that MRA could disclose project contracts and memorandum of agreements in accordance with recommendations in EITI Reports. The MSG noted in its feedback on the draft Validation report that the Mineral resources Authority had made efforts through the MSG to disclose a list of mining memoranda of agreement (MOAs) in recent EITI Reports. The PNGEITI National Secretariat has been involved in the State Negotiation Team attending Mining Development Forums for new projects and in the MOA reviews of existing mining projects that resulted in including EITI transparency clauses into the mining agreements (Woodlark Mine and K92 Mining would be the first to disclose parts of the agreement).
Despite these indications, no extractives license or contract texts have been publicly disclosed in PNG. It is not possible to determine whether this represents a significant gap in compliance with Requirement 2.4.a, which requires the disclosure of all licenses and contracts entered into or amended after 1 January 2021, since there is no publicly available and comprehensive list of contracts and licenses entered into. As noted in the following section on licenses and property rights, while the mining cadastre maintained by MRA appears to be comprehensive, it does not clarify which tenements are pro forma and to which a mining agreement is associated. The DPE meanwhile has only disclosed information on licenses for the fiscal year 2019. 
Several obstacles to the disclosure of contract and license texts have been noted and the 2019 EITI Report makes particular note of privacy and confidentiality protections in Section 163 of the Mining Act, Section 52 of the MRA Act, and Section 149 of the Oil and Gas Act. These legal barriers were confirmed in stakeholder consultations and by the Contract Transparency (CT) Report commissioned by the MSG, which also noted cultural and capacity barriers, estimating that “there are approximately 118 active exploitation licences for oil, gas and minerals. Each licence could require the disclosure of several documents” (page 4). Consultations with government suggest that government systems for contract transparency are yet to be developed, and that even government agencies, such as the revenue administration, only have access to contracts upon request.
Consultations nevertheless suggest that contract transparency would be welcome by many stakeholders, including several companies, as contract disclosure would be helpful in managing perceptions about the extractives industry in PNG. However, there appear to be diverging views within the company constituency about contract transparency, also among EITI supporting companies. Consulted government stakeholders noted contract transparency would facilitate monitoring of compliance with the terms of contracts, for both the public and the government.
Both the 2019 EITI Report and the CT Report make specific recommendations on how to overcome these obstacles, and the latter includes a Roadmap by which PNGEITI could pursue compliance with Requirement 2.4. The 2019 EITI Report describes initial conversations regarding reforms with the State Solicitor, and openness for pursuing reforms within the MRA, though consultations suggest that these conversations have not progressed. Though contract transparency is mentioned in PNGEITI work plans, document review stakeholder consultations were not able to identify any planning or progress towards compliance with Requirement 2.4. This may in part be due to the perceived difficulty of overcoming obstacles, and consulted stakeholders noted that the process for legal reform is laborious in PNG and that the MSG had not yet developed a strategy for addressing this.
The MSG argued in its feedback on the draft Validation report that the requirement should be assessed as Mostly met. The MSG noted that the legal reforms resulting in contract transparency requires a whole of government approach and takes time. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down follow-up on the contract transparency study, The MSG also flagged the efforts and progress made towards disclosing memoranda of agreement (MOAs) with local stakeholders. The Secretariat recognises the barriers identified by the MSG and the efforts made, but considers that the level of progress does not justify an assessment of Mostly met in accordance with the Validation Guide."

Based on comments provided in the template and feedback gathered through stakeholder consultations, most stakeholders considered that the objective has largely been fulfilled. From the Secretariat’s perspective, Peru maintains good practice in terms of comprehensively publishing the full text of oil and gas contracts, including amendments, annexes and riders. Perupetro provides a complete list of all exploration and exploitation contracts. In mining, systematically disclosed lists of awarded mining concessions and investment contracts provide comprehensive coverage of active concessions and it is the Secretariat’s understanding that concessions are pro forma. Stability contracts are disclosed and the Peruvian Agency for Private Investment (Proinversion) provides a list that includes all active contracts. Considering these factors, the objective of ensuring the public accessibility of all licenses and contracts underpinning extractive activities, as a basis for the public’s understanding of the contractual rights and obligations of companies operating in the country’s extractive industries, is fulfilled. 
Peru does not have a specific government policy on contract transparency. Consulted government stakeholders considered the 2019 Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information (LOTAIP) to sufficiently ensure that licenses and contracts can be published. These stakeholders noted that all oil and gas contracts and mining licenses are published under LOTAIP and a standalone law on contract disclosure was not necessary. 
Perupetro, as the state-owned enterprise (SOE) in the oil and gas sector, enters into license and service contracts with independent oil companies and also operates its own wells. Perupetro publishes the original contracts and what appears to be amendments, annexes and riders to contracts for each lot on its website. These publications include contracts entered into both before and after 1 January 2021 and fulfils the aspect of Requirement 2.4 that mandates full publication of contracts entered into or amended after the beginning of 2021. In 2021-2022, there were 25 active exploitation contracts and seven exploration contracts in 2021, with this figure dropping to six in 2022. Currently, there are 27 active exploitation contracts and five active exploration contracts.
In mining, pro forma mining concessions are typically used to grant mining rights. The model mining concession is publicly available on the INGEMMET website and is also described through EITI reporting. The 2021-2022 EITI Report provides a list of all active mining concessions. This information is mirrored on the Institute for Geology, Mining and Metallurgy (INGEMMET) website and contains information on concessions awarded before and after 1 January 2021. Exploration investment contracts are also used in circumstances requiring significant investment at the exploration phase. These contracts offer certain incentives, such as tax offsets equivalent to sales tax paid on capital expenditures linked to exploration activities. The full text of these contracts is available on the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) website.
Another important, though less-frequently used mode of granting mining concessions are Stability Contracts (Contrato de Garantía y Medidas de Promoción a la Inversión) are signed with mining companies that assure that the financial and economic terms agreed-upon at signing are maintained throughout the life of the contract. EITI reporting outlines the basic tenets of stability contracts and the Proinversion website provides a publicly available list to these contracts, with links to the full contract text."

In practice, most mining contracts are published, and the three oil and gas contracts in production are published. While the MSG’s comments noted that contracts of coal had been published on the PH-EITI Contracts portal, the comprehensiveness of contract publications remains unclear (with the material company Semirara’s contract not appearing on the portal for instance). The MSG has included plans to assess the comprehensiveness of contact disclosure to date in its 2021 work plan. The recent publication of PMDC’s joint operating agreements (JOAs) with its operators, referenced in the MSG’s comments, is commendable. The MGB and DOE have confirmed that no operating contract has been awarded or amended in the 1 January - 31 March 2021 period. However, the 6th PH-EITI Report’s reference to the DOE’s inability to publish contracts whose project terms are still active is a concern, as it raises questions about the prospects for the systematic publication of new coal, oil and gas contracts and amendments in future. Nonetheless, government officials consulted did not raise any barriers to the publication of all operating contracts in the coal, oil and gas sectors, evidenced by the recent publication of some contracts. Of more immediate concern, there does not appear to be a comprehensive list of active contracts and licenses (including exploration licenses) indicating which contracts are publicly accessible and which are not. In addition, the full text of licenses does not appear to be published and it is unclear whether there are significant variations between licenses (permits)."

State contract disclosure practices are aligned with policy, which the MSG has documented.

Sierra Leone has made commendable progress in addressing encouraged aspects of the requirement by disclosing mining agreements entered into prior to January 2021. Following the draft Validation report, NMA disclosed mining contracts entered into after 1 January 2021. However, there is still no clear government policy on the disclosure of mining contracts and the full text of pro forma licenses remains confidential. It also remains unclear if any oil and gas contract was entered into in 2021. The Secretariat considers that the objective of the requirement is mostly fulfilled.
The policy on disclosure of mining contracts continues to be unclear, although in practice all contracts that were active on 31 December 2019 appear to have been disclosed by the government through a third-party webpage. Stakeholder consultations and media sources suggest that the Marampa Mines agreement was ratified by Parliament in December 2021. A comprehensive list of contracts entered into after 2019 is now available. Following the draft Validation report, NMA disclosed the contracts for Marampa Mines, Kingho Mining and Kingho Rail & Port on its website, and confirmed that these were the only mining agreements entered into since 1 January 2021. 
While the actual disclosures of older contracts exceed some provisions of Requirement 2.4, the lack of explicit policy to disclose mining contracts entered into or amended, is considered a material gap by the International Secretariat. The importance of establishing a clear policy is heightened by ongoing and recently concluded contract negotiations. The MSG argues in its feedback on the draft Validation report that the 2018 Minerals Policy and the Mines and Minerals Act together establish a policy for contract transparency. The Secretariat recognises that these policies enable the disclosure of mining contracts. However, they do not establish a clear policy that institutionalises contract transparency. The effect of this is demonstrated in the delay in disclosing recent mining contracts, which were only published following the draft Validation report.
At the time of review, the NMA website listed in this template was not operational and therefore, a review of the available contracts on this website was not possible. However, the ResourceContracts website does provide what appears to be the full text, including amendments, riders, and annexes of ten large-scale mining agreements, which is an improvement from the prior Validation cycle. The 2019 EITI Report notes that there is a bill currently being debated by Parliament, the SLEITI Bill, that would lend weight to contract disclosure, though it may fall short of instituting legally binding policy. A clear policy on disclosure of oil and gas contracts exists in 2011 Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act. The 2019 EITI Report notes that one oil and gas contract has been agreed since 1 January 2021, but this contract has yet to be ratified by Parliament and is therefore not currently available. Consulted government representatives noted that once ratified by Parliament, the contract would become public. However, media reports suggest that the Parliament ratified the contract with Innoson Oil and Gas already in April 2021. The MSG feedback on the draft Validation report did not provide clarity on this issue.
The National Minerals Agency's MCAS portal provides a comprehensive list of all active mining licenses, including licenses awarded after 1 January 2021, but full text of these licenses is not included, and the cadastre does not note which licenses are accompanied by a mining agreement.  Consulted government representatives confirmed that the content of these licenses is pro forma and derived from the legislation.  However, the Secretariat was not able to locate written, publicly available confirmation of this or access the license template. The MSG submitted the license templates to the Secretariat as part of its feedback on the draft Validation report. However, these documents have not been publicly disclosed and are therefore not considered in this assessment. The 2019 EITI Report confirms that there were no active oil and gas licenses in Sierra Leone at the end of 2019."

Stakeholders consulted did not express particular views on progress towards the objective of public understanding of contractual rights and obligations in the extractive industries. The Secretariat considers that the objective is mostly met taking into account systematic disclosure of some contracts, but given the lack of a review of comprehensiveness of contract and license disclosure by TL-EITI and limitations related to enabling full contract transparency.  

Article 30 of the Law on Petroleum Activities notes the requirement to disclose contracts. However, it appears unclear whether the requirement applies to full texts of contracts or their summaries. In addition, Article 25 of the Mining Code includes a provision requiring public disclosure of mining contracts. Timor-Leste’s 2019 EITI Report documents confidentiality clauses that limit public accessibility of a number of contracts in the oil and gas sector but does not discuss efforts to overcome these constraints. It does not appear that these confidentiality provisions extend to the mining sector.  

There appear to have been several awards of new contracts in the extractive sector since January 2021, although the negotiations are still ongoing. According to the ANPM website, these contracts will be published online upon conclusion of contract negotiations. It appears that a number of production sharing contracts (PSCs) had been published in the Official Gazette and online (JPDA, TLEA), including those awarded prior to 2021. There appear to be six PSCs in the oil and gas sector where publication of the full text, including annexes, amendments and riders, is not possible due to legal barriers. However, the ANPM website discloses summaries of the key terms of these PSCs. It remains unclear if disclosure of these PSCs would be possible in case of any amendments. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG noted disclosure of some active PSCs, but did not clarify whether all PSCs granted, entered into and amended since 1 January 2021 have been disclosed in full. The comments explain that some information on contracts is disclosed two years after the contract is lodged with the government authority. The comments also provide an update on the Timor Sea Maritime Boundary Treaty but do not clarify any developments related to the disclosure of the full text of extractives contracts. A review of the ANPM website indicates that the full text of some additional licenses and contracts has been published since the start of Validation. However, there remains no publicly accessible comprehensive list of all active licenses and contracts (including annexes, amendments and riders) indicating where each document is publicly accessible and highlighting those contractual documents that have not yet been published.  

A list of mining licenses awarded since 2006 is publicly available, and a government official consulted confirmed that no mining license awarded prior to 2006 remained active today. The MSG has not yet clarified whether all mining licenses are pro forma. A government official consulted confirmed that oil and gas PSCs were not pro forma and that there were important differences between contracts, particularly those concluded prior to 2015.
  
The MSG does not yet appear to have published a comprehensive list of all active mining, oil and gas licenses and contracts, indicating which are publicly accessible and which are not, with specific links to access each published document where available.  "

Despite a strong policy commitment from the Ukrainian government to contract transparency, disclosure practices currently do not fully meet the requirements of the EITI Standard. Stakeholders acknowledged the existence of gaps in disclosure practices, which impact the objective of ensuring comprehensive public understanding of the obligations of companies active in the extractive industries.
The government’s policy on contract transparency is defined in the Law of Ukraine ""On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine on Ensuring Transparency in Extractive Industries"" (referred to in the EITI Report as the EITI Law). The law requires the disclosure of contracts signed from January 2021 onwards, as well as the disclosure of key terms and excerpts for all PSAs. The requirement to disclose the full text of agreements does not apply to contracts signed before the law came into effect or to amendments to older contracts. 
The list of all licenses, PSAs, joint activity agreements and concessions is available in the EITI Report, the EITI portal and the government’s open data portal. The EITI Report explains the status of disclosure of these agreements. 
Under normal circumstances, key terms and excerpts have been disclosed for many PSAs, including some of those signed before the EITI’s contract disclosure requirement came into effect. However, those key terms and excerpts are redacted under martial law. Full text disclosures are not available. Stakeholders noted that the disclosure of key terms and excerpts for some PSAs was disrupted by the Russian invasion and the declaration of martial law. Moreover, stakeholders noted that disclosure of the PSA for the Yuzivska shale gas project signed in 2013 was not covered by the EITI Law and therefore not subject to disclosure. 
For contracts for subsoil use, scanned copies of license documents together with agreements on the conditions of subsoil use (including work programmes) were previously systematically published on the website of the State Service of Geology. However, due to martial law, access is currently restricted. 
Stakeholders noted that the decision to restrict public access to contracts was proportionate in light of the current security context. Stakeholders said that they expected contract disclosure to resume after the end of martial law, including for PSAs signed from January 2021 onwards for which key terms and excerpts have not yet been disclosed."

Additional efforts will be needed for Zambia to fully meet Phase II of the requirement, to be assessed in its next Validation. Licenses awarded in 2021 are not publicly disclosed. In their comments to the draft Validation report, ZEC noted that government entities do not deviate from its (non-disclosure) policies on license and contract disclosures. Additionally, there is currently no legal framework or practice guaranteeing comprehensive disclosure of the contents of future or current licenses. However, Zambia EITI have made a first attempt to provide a partial list of which extractive licenses, concessions and development agreements are publicly available, through third-party sources, but only for a few licenses awarded ahead of the latest legislation. Zambia EITI also publishes the complete list of licenses that exist in Zambia, while noting that no license or contract is currently systematically disclosed apart from through third-party sources. However, Zambia EITI is also currently undertaking a study to further its ambitions for public disclosure of all licenses and contracts awarded or amended in 2021 onwards. ZEC noted that this study, combined with other activities such as adoption of a transparency bill, all represent a cogent plan for overcoming technical and legal challenges to contract disclosure. In its interpretation of what constitutes a “published plan with a clear time frame reflected in work plans addressing any barriers to comprehensive disclosure”, the International Secretariat considers that Phase I of EITI requirements on license and contract disclosure have been fully met. However, there are still concerns related to whether Zambia EITI will be able to fully meet the requirements of Phase II, when legal and practical barriers to contract disclosure must have overcome and that all new extractive contracts and licenses are fully disclosed from 1 January 2022 onwards."

The Federal Government committed to establishing a central beneficial ownership register and to ensure transparency in the ownership of companies at the UK Anti-Corruption Summit in 2016, although this commitment did not explicitly extend to establishing a public register. Argentina’s Open Government Partnership National Action Plan (most recently in the 4th NAP covering 2019-2022) does not include a commitment to ensure the transparency in beneficial owners of extractive companies, but rather to disclose information regarding the economic, legal and fiscal aspects of the extractive activities as noted in the MSG’s comments on the draft assessment. While there is a legal and regulatory framework for both the IGJ and AFIP to collect beneficial ownership information from all companies in Argentina, there does not appear to yet be a legal or regulatory framework for the disclosure of beneficial ownership information due to the interpretation of fiscal secrecy laws that hinder both the IGJ and AFIP’s disclosure of this type of information. Argentina's MSG has recently agreed upon a definition of beneficial ownership that sets a threshold (20%) in line with the National Inspectorate of Justice, the General Inspectorate of Justice, the Financial Intelligence Unit and AFIP, and covers all individuals holding capital or voting rights. The concept of 'politically exposed person' is defined in Argentine legislation.
Argentina's EITI reporting indicates that beneficial ownership data has been requested from those companies participating in the second EITI Report. However, in practice, a total of only two mining companies disclosed information on beneficial ownership in the EITI Reports. In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG highlighted the work of its Technical Working Group on Tax and Regulatory Matters (TWGTRM) in 2020 on developing the definition of beneficial owner and overseeing ‘voluntary’ reporting to the EITI. The MSG’s comments noted that beneficial ownership disclosures of reporting companies were in the first two EITI Reports. The TWGTRM had also undertaken an analysis of the legal framework for beneficial ownership disclosure, which was published in Annex III of Argentina’s first EITI Report. Given the complexity of the regulations involved, the TWGTRM had also developed an implementation plan for beneficial ownership transparency. The MSG’s comments also highlighted the significance of Argentina’s joining the EITI’s Opening Extractives programme and the designation of government liaisons.
Yet there remain significant gaps in the public disclosure of beneficial owners of companies holding or applying for offshore oil and gas licenses in Argentina. It remains unclear from EITI disclosures whether beneficial ownership data has systematically been requested from all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses since January 2020. There is no indication that the MSG has yet undertaken and published a review of the comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership disclosures by all extractive license-holders and applicants to date. Legal ownership information for all commercial companies is collected by the IGJ and is said to be available upon request in Argentina’s EITI Reports, although consulted stakeholder opinions on the public accessibility of shareholder information for extractive companies were split. The MSG does not appear to have requested legal ownership information from the IGJ to test whether requests for public information are processed in a timely manner. There does not appear to be a central database of legal owners of extractive companies accessible online.
Development partners consulted noted that Argentina EITI had participated in a working group with agencies such as the Buenos Aires IGJ, the Financial Intelligence Unit, and AFIP to progress on beneficial ownership transparency work. Several stakeholders from all constituencies highlighted the EITI Report’s statement that over 90% of extractive companies are registered with the Buenos Aires IGJ, which meant this was the natural entity to participate in beneficial ownership work. Argentina’s joining of the Opening Extractives programme was cited by several stakeholders from different constituencies as a positive step that could accelerate progress. While government stakeholders indicated that there was a will to work on beneficial ownership transparency on the part of some government stakeholders, none of the stakeholders consulted considered that the objective of enabling the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries had yet been achieved. The MSG’s comments on the draft assessment argued strongly for the view that the overall objective of the requirement was fulfilled through Argentina EITI’s data collection efforts. They noted that the conclusions of a consultancy under the Opening Extractives programme included that most extractive companies in the scope of EITI reporting were registered with the Buenos Aires IGJ, but that it would be preferable to proceed with publication of beneficial ownership data through other channels than the IGJ in the short term. The comments noted ongoing consultations within government on the findings of this report, but that the MSG may consider applying to the EITI Board for adapted implementation on Requirement 2.5. While Argentina’s work on beneficial ownerrship transparency, including through the Opening Extractives programme, are welcome, the lack of an enabling legal and regulatory framework for beneficial ownership data collection and public disclosure hinders progress towards the objective of ensuring a public understanding of who ultimately owns compannies holding and applying for extractive licenses and contracts."

However, in the MSG’s assessment of comprehensiveness and reliability of BO disclosures, Albeiti does not reference publicly accessible information per company (only publishing their conclusions, not the underlying BO data). The MSG has also not assessed disclosures through the newly launched beneficial ownership registry of the National Business Centre (QKB). Albeiti does not appear to maintain a list of material companies’ legal or BO owners themselves at present. The Beneficial Ownership Register also appears to have some gaps in its beneficial ownership disclosures and does not indicate in any way which companies are publicly listed on (foreign) stock exchanges. While the register does include some BO information, it does not currently indicate whether beneficial owners are publicly exposed persons (PEPs), and current legislation does not appear to guarantee that all PEPs are indicated as BO for any company, regardless of their level of control. Legal ownership of extractive companies is disclosed by the QKB. Lastly, the EITI Report clearly indicates that there are no current verification methods or means by the government agencies, with the exception of penalties for failure to disclose or incorrect disclosures."

The objective of this requirement is to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries, particularly those identified by the MSG as high-risk, to help deter improper practices in the management of extractive resources. The Secretariat’s assessment is that the objective has been exceeded, given the substantial efforts in effectively implementing public disclosures of beneficial ownership information in the mining sector and in establishing a public register of beneficial owners in line with international standards.
There is an enabling legal framework for beneficial ownership disclosure in Armenia. Laws and regulations are systematically disclosed through ARLIS, including the amendment to the RA Law “On State Registration of Legal Entities, Separate Subdivisions of Legal Entities, Institutions and Individual Entrepreneurs"" and the RA Law “On Additions and amendments to the Subsoil Code of the Republic of Armenia”. Since 2020, all companies applying for or holding mining rights are required to submit beneficial ownership information to the State Register of Legal Entities under the Ministry of Justice. The definition of beneficial owner has been amended as a result of the new series of laws passed in June 2021 and changes are stated in the 2020-2021 Armenia EITI Report. The RA Law ""On Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing"" was also amended to harmonise the definition. There is now one unified definition to comply with disclosures required by the State Register of Legal Entities. However, government stakeholders confirmed that there are still minor differences in definitions by other competent authorities, such as that of the tax authority, which will be further revised. The definition is in line with the EITI Standard. The 2022 Scoping Report developed by the Opening Extractives programme also states that thresholds were set using a risk-based approach, in line with international best practice, with a lower threshold of 10% for the metal minerals sector and 20% for the rest of the economy. There is no minimum threshold for persons with the duty to submit a declaration of interests (politically exposed persons). 
Beneficial ownership information is systematically disclosed on the online beneficial ownership register hosted by the State Register of Legal Entities under the Ministry of Justice. The series of amendments passed in 2021 also included the revisions to the beneficial ownership declaration form and procedures for completion and approval, through Order No. 416-N15. Declaration forms can be downloaded from the online register. Links to all beneficial ownership declarations by the 26 metal mining companies are available in the 2020-2021 Armenia EITI Report. Information on the register is now open to anyone, marking a significant improvement in accessibility. Previously, beneficial ownership information was restricted solely to individuals accessing the register from an Armenian IP address. Armenia is one of the few countries globally that implements the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS), which provides a structured data format to simplify the sharing and use of beneficial ownership information.  Since the launch of the software in 2021, only 35 companies had to submit declarations. However, in 2022 the number of declarations increased substantially, with almost 50,000 declarations received as of August 2023, as the disclosures now cover all sectors of the economy. The country has also integrated the BODS data visualiser directly into its register, enabling users to produce ownership graphs from the data easily, and facilitating the understanding and analysis of company structures. A recent analysis from a technical partner highlighted that several pieces of data available on the online register are still not in the BODS data.  
All data points listed in Requirement 2.5.d are requested as part of the BO reporting template. Disclosures of political impact and conflict of interest required by the Corruption Prevention Commission (CPC) also request information on ownership. Beneficial ownership declarations also require the provision of links to the stock exchange filings of the parent company of wholly owned subsidiaries of publicly listed companies, however, stakeholder consultations confirmed that none of such entities exist in Armenia. The 2021 Validation of Requirement 2.5 identified an issue related to the legal owners of closed joint-stock companies (CJSCs). The national secretariat confirmed that beneficial ownership information is requested from and provided by these companies, and that the 2020-2021 EITI Report reported these disclosures. Stakeholder consultations indicated that the MSG is discussing how to make this information systematically available. Information on legal owners is disclosed through the beneficial ownership declaration. The EITI Armenia website also holds information on legal owners for mining companies. This represents a crucial step towards compliance with this Requirement since the previous Validation.
The 2020-2021 EITI Report states that the 2021 RA Law “On Amendments and additions to the Code of Administrative Offenses” includes sanctions for violating the rules of disclosure of information on beneficial owners, which apply to the declaring entity and the individual responsible for submitting the declaration. They include administrative responsibility for not submitting information or for submitting incorrect or incomplete, and failure to conduct due diligence. Additional penalties are provided for within the extractive industries, namely the suspension or termination of permits to operate if BO data is not submitted by 120 days after the deadline. The incipient nature of the verification mechanisms available to the relevant authorities to conduct checks result in non-compliance focused on aspects related to submission, rather than deliberate falsehood of the data. Civil society stakeholders consulted raised concerns with current sanctions, stating that fines are too low. Substantial efforts have been made to increase compliance among smaller companies, where the biggest challenges lie, as there is a lack of awareness of the concept and how to report.
There has been no assessment performed by the MSG on comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership disclosures. However, consultations confirmed that all constituencies have been thoroughly involved in the reforms that have led to disclosures, as well as the improvement of the register in advance and post its launch. Stakeholders stated that the concerted efforts of all constituencies led to several phases of improvement of legislation and systems over the past three years. The State Register holds responsibility for checking the accuracy of filings under Armenian law. Certain automated checks are in place at the point of submission, such as cross-checks with the passport database for Armenian citizens, to ensure that entered data corresponds to expected format and values, and to introduce dropdown fields. These checks are meant to tackle accidental input errors. However, there is scope for improving systematic mechanisms to tackle deliberate false reports. Civil society stakeholders consulted stated that beneficial ownership information has been one of the key datasets that have been used for analyses in the mining sector. There have been clear examples of use of beneficial ownership information, mainly by journalists, some with support of the Opening Extractives programme. For example, a recent article used beneficial ownership data and the BODS visualised to investigate gold exploration in the Lori Marz area, finding Russian and Czech interests in the companies involved. Another investigation was conducted on settlements that were not included in the ""affected"" list and consequently did not receive royalties from extractive projects. Beneficial ownership data was employed to ascertain whether there were any personal interests among politicians influencing this decision. Stakeholders consulted confirmed that the EITI national secretariat has been instrumental in linking up civil society with government stakeholders in order to improve investigations and retrieve information.
Several amendments to relevant legislation were approved in 2021 to expand the scope of reporting from mining to all sectors. Consultations with stakeholders confirmed that this has been an important achievement for the EITI process, as the reform, initiated in the mining sector, subsequently led to a whole of economy reform. There were unified views from consultations across all constituencies with government, corporate, and civil society stakeholders, affirming that this reform stands as a cornerstone achievement of EITI implementation. Government representatives also confirmed that substantial efforts were made in order to support private sector compliance with the disclosures, including a national capacity-building campaign. The company constituency confirmed that the developments surrounding the beneficial ownership reform allowed for more trust in the mining sector. As of August 2023, the Ministry of Justice confirmed that they had received 49,247 declarations, which amounts to approximately 50% of all registered companies in Armenia, including companies that are not operating. The new Anti-Corruption plan for the years 2023-2026 includes further capacity building to strengthen the beneficial ownership register, to harmonise legislation in order to have one single definition of beneficial owner, efforts to promote verification, training for the private sector (SMEs) to comply with the requirements."

Stakeholders consulted considered there were important improvements achieved in the past three years and that the objective of this requirement is mostly fulfilled. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report reiterate the MSG’s view that the objective has been mostly met. The Secretariat’s view is that, while an enabling legal and regulatory environment for the collection of beneficial owners for all extractives companies has been put in place and is in the early stages of implementation, the objective is not yet met given the lack of systematic collection and disclosure of legal and beneficial owners of companies applying for and holding extractives licences. Indeed, the MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report note that beneficial ownership information has not yet been collected from companies applying for extractive licenses given the lack of an enabling legal framework for the collection of such information at the application stage, which the MSG explains is one of the reasons for the ongoing reforms of the Mining Code. Nonetheless, in the interim, the MSG's comments note that the Ministry of Mines is “taking account” of the need to collect beneficial ownership information as part of the license award process, even if the Secretariat is not able to access any such beneficial ownership information collected to date. Furthermore, the underlying objective is not met since public access to records is only given if “legitimate interest” can be demonstrated. Besides the review in the EITI Report of ownership disclosure by the selection of companies covered by the EITI Report, there is no review by EITI-BF of the status or risk-based approach of beneficial ownership data collection and disclosure. Few material companies submitted the requested ownership information for the 2020 EITI Report.  

Burkina Faso EITI has been a key driver in the formulation and implementation of legal reform. The MSG has agreed a definition of the term beneficial owner within Decree No. 2021-0493 promulgated on 7 June 2021. This decree was specific to the extractive sector and created a declaration requirement for companies applying for licenses, owning shares in companies applying for licenses and holding licenses. The decree instituted a register of beneficial owners lodged at Ouagadougou’s Trade Court, as well as a parallel register of beneficial owners lodged within each applicable company. The Trade Court’s register of beneficial owners is accessible to the public without any fee, but the information is only disclosed if the request to the judge is justified and supported by legitimate interest for accessing the data. The 2022 decree extended the requirement for ownership disclosures to all companies. The threshold for disclosing beneficial ownership information is set at 25% in all economic sectors. The principle of a national register of beneficial owners lodged at Ouagadougou’s Trade Court is maintained, alongside the requirement for companies to maintain updated beneficial ownership information on their own companies. The definition of beneficial owner is aligned with Requirement 2.5.f.i and takes international norms and relevant national laws into account. It specifies reporting obligations for PEPs (article 13).  

The 2022 decree requires the establishment of a national register of beneficial owners within the trade court (article 4)), to be monitored by the judge in charge of the commercial register (RCCM). The accuracy of the beneficial ownership information to be provided is, according to the decree, assessed by the authorities of the trade register. The 2022 budget requires companies registered in Burkina Faso to submit their beneficial ownership information with their annual tax filings. It also contains a provision for a penalty of XOF 500,000 for the failure to declare. It further states that companies must maintain updated records of their beneficial owners and present the information on request. At the initiative of EITI-BF a joint template was agreed for the declaration of beneficial owners, the Trade court and the tax office. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report highlight reforms to the General Tax Code (Articles 96.1-96.5) following the enactment of the 2023 government budget (loi des finances), which the MSG explains reinforced provisions for the identification and disclosure of beneficial owners of companies. The MSG’s comments emphasise the obligation for all companies to report their beneficial ownership information as part of their tax reporting obligations, with 2000 companies across all economic sectors having reported such information to the Tax Department to date.  

Burkina Faso’s beneficial ownership road map covering 2016-2019 was adopted by the MSG in 2016, with another one published in December 2019 covering 2020-2022.86 The 2021 progress report87 indicates that the MSG had discussions to draft and comment on the 2021 decree on beneficial ownership before it was approved by the Council of Ministers. A workshop was organised in July 2021 to raise awareness and support the implementation of the new decree on beneficial ownership. The 2022-2024 work plan contains activities on beneficial ownership transparency, consisting in disseminating the decree and extending beneficial ownership disclosure to other sectors. The MSG continued to play an active role in 2022 by discussing and approving the beneficial ownership templates to be used as per the 2022 decree. 

With regards to broader beneficial ownership disclosures, in December 2022 the judge in charge of monitoring the register of beneficial owners within Ouagadougou’s trade court officially requested all companies to declare their beneficial owners to the register, regardless of their sector of activity.88 The request of information requires a form to be filled, which includes the identity of the beneficial owner(s), including nationality, country of residence, and identification of politically exposed persons, the level of ownership and details about how ownership or control is exerted. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report also confirm that the beneficial ownership reporting templates for the 2020 EITI Report explicitly required information on any politically exposed persons. With regards to public access, the 2022 decree stipulates that beneficial ownership information is accessible for free, albeit based on legitimate interest only. This implies that beneficial ownership information is not foreseen to be freely available online, without the need for specific requests to access the data. Government entities shall have access to beneficial ownership information to carry out its functions. Stakeholder consultations have confirmed that the register is paper-based, and thus the request for records will be needed to be filled manually. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue that implementation of beneficial ownership transparency must take place within the context of national laws, which restrict the disclosure of any personal information on individuals subject a judge’s authorisation. The MSG explains that this is the reason why disclosure of beneficial ownership data can only be upon a justified request to a judge based on legitimate reasons for access to this data as prescribed in Government Order (arrêté) 2023-0097/MEFP/MJDHRI of March 2023.  

During consultations, the authorities indicated that no information was provided by companies yet for the register of beneficial owners, and that it was first necessary to raise awareness about the new legislation among extractive companies subject to reporting before moving to enforcement of the new legal provisions. Burkina Faso’s 2020 EITI Report has assessed and documented gaps in disclosure of beneficial ownership information, but only for the 17 material companies within the report. This assessment shows that almost none of the corporate entities that had applied for or hold a participating interest in an exploration or production oil, gas or mining license or contract, have disclosed the requested ownership information. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report confirm that the names of material companies that did not report their beneficial ownership information is provided in Annex 3 of the 2020 EITI Report, which the Secretariat confirms. The MSG’s comments also highlighted the MSG’s discussions around the reliability of beneficial ownership data collected at a September 2020 meeting, as part of the preparation of the government decree on beneficial ownership. The MSG argues that it has discussed the status of beneficial ownership disclosure as part of the preparation of every EITI Report since 2019, including relevant stakeholders beyond MSG members. For ten out of 11 material companies that are wholly owned subsidiaries of publicly listed companies, the name of the stock exchange has been disclosed within the EITI Report. The link to the stock exchange filings where they are listed is mentioned for all companies, except for one company (SOMITA SA). The five privately owned companies failed to declare their beneficial owners. There is no evidence of the MSG discussing the gaps or the reliability of the disclosed ownership information. There is no evidence of the MSG formulating a risk-based approach for the collection of data on companies outside of the reporting scope, such as companies holding multiple exploration licences. The MSG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue that a beneficial ownership register has been established and that 2000 companies from all economic sectors have provided beneficial ownership information, which is publicly accessible “upon request”. The MSG’s comments highlighted ongoing plans for the establishment of a public beneficial ownership register accessible online.  

Regarding legal owners and share of ownership of companies, Burkina Faso’s report indicates that this information in principle is obtainable at the commercial register (RCCM), free of charge, upon request. However, given that the register is not accessible online and that there is no evidence of EITI-BF testing the accessibility of legal ownership information in this way, there remain questions about whether shareholder information is indeed publicly accessible for all companies in the extractive industries. The EITI Report identifies the shareholders of the 17 material companies in the scope of the report, but not the legal owners of all companies applying for, or holding, a licence. A closer review of the legal owners of material companies highlights some gaps in shareholder information provided, such as the owners of the company Nordgold, cited in recent national press coverage of the extractive industries.

While Colombia enacted legislation defining government policy on beneficial ownership in September 2021, the deadline for companies to submit this information is June 2023.  Given the extended deadline for reporting it appears too early for the MSG to provide an assessment on the comprehensiveness of collection efforts. The objective of this requirement is to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in Colombia’s extractive industries to help deter improper practices in the management of extractive resources. Despite robust legislation in favour of collecting beneficial ownership information, the public does not have access to this information, leaving the objective of this requirement partly met. In their comments on the draft Validation report, civil society expressed support for this assessment and called for the development of a roadmap for progressing towards full beneficial ownership transparency. The EITI Colombia Secretariat’s comments on the draft assessment note that, while there is no public beneficial ownership register yet, EITI Colombia had carried out a series of workshops and studies on the subject, had provided input to the development of the legal framework, had socialised beneficial ownership transparency with relevant government agencies and developed good practices in reviewing beneficial ownership data to improve due diligence in the licensing process. The comments noted that, while there were currently no provisions for beneficial ownership information to be publicly disclosed, this would be a priority for the MSG moving forward, at least for companies included in the scope of Colombia’s EITI reporting. The MSG’s common comments on the draft Validation report highlighted the progress achieved to date, even if there was more to do. The Secretariat acknowledges the significant work undertaken by the MSG and government authorities in establishing an enabling legal framework for beneficial ownership data collection and in launching the collection of such data. However, in the absence of an enabling legal and regulatory environment for the public disclosure of beneficial ownership data and the lack of assurances that ownership data has been requested from all companies holding or applying for mining and petroleum rights, combined with the lack of a published assessment of the comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership data collection to date, the Secretariat’s view is that the objective is not yet fulfilled and thus that Requirement 2.5 is partly met.  

The Colombian government passed Law 2155 on Social Investment in September 2021, which details government policy on beneficial ownership and is regulated by Resolution 000164. These laws were highlighted again in the government constituency’s comments on the draft Validation report. While a definition of beneficial ownership and politically exposed persons, and thresholds for their disclosure are defined in Law 2155, this law stops short of requiring the public disclosure of beneficial ownership information and only the tax authority (DIAN), the General Consult of the Republic, the Attorney General’s Office and the Financial Information and Analysis Unit have access to this information. Law 2155 requires all Colombian companies to report BO information to DIAN, including those bidding and applying for extractive licenses. While Law 2155 does not fully account for foreign legal owners, a March 2022 resolution, Resolution No. 000037 of 2022, modified existing legislation to minimize conflicting language. Given that Colombian legal persons, permanent establishments and/or structures without legal persons are already required to report, foreign legal owners are only required to report when their investment is not made through a Colombian entity already required to report BO information.  

While Law 2155 was passed at the end of the period under review and initial collection efforts may still be underway, there is no assessment from the MSG on collection efforts and it is not clear what the MSG’s approach is to ensure the public disclosure of this information. One government stakeholder indicated that the establishment of Law 2155 for the collection of BO information was in the government's interest and was not an initiative aimed at the public disclosure of this information. Likewise, while there is a company register with legal ownership information through the Single Tax Registry, this information is not publicly accessible. Concerning those government agencies that do have access to BO information, one government stakeholder noted that there should be more interagency communication to facilitate data sharing. This is particularly relevant given that the Ministry of Mines and Ministry of Environment do not have access to BO information. "

Stakeholders consulted considered that the objective of transparency in ownership of extractive companies is still not achieved, given that the legal and regulatory framework had yet to be finalised in order to enable the collection and public disclosure of beneficial ownership data. Partial BO data collection has started through an online platform supported by the GIZ and through the traditional EITI reporting cycle. It allowed BO data to be disclosed for some companies engaged in the extractive sector, although this is still at an early stage. 
The MSG had assessed and documented gaps or weaknesses in disclosure of beneficial ownership information, including an assessment of the materiality of omissions and the reliability of beneficial information. Most Civil society stakeholders consulted considers the lack of progress in BO disclosures as an issue and highlighted a possible lack of political will. The Secretariat’s view is that the objective is only partly met. 
The EITI Report did not identify clear government policies nor a legal framework on beneficial ownership disclosure. However, the budget state law for 2019 introduced a provision on beneficial ownership requiring the companies to submit to the tax administration a list of their beneficial owners as defined by the provisions of Law No. 2016-992 of November 14, 2016 relating to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The law n° 2019-1080 of December 18, 2019 on the State Budget for the year 2020 introduced the obligation for legal persons, whatever their form and their activity, to produce, before the start of their operations, a declaration, according to a template established by the tax department, relating to the identity of their beneficial owners within the meaning of national and international standards on the fight against money laundering, the financing of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As per our consultations with tax department, we understood that the information received are not meant to be publicly disclosed but used by the department as part of their investigation work. 
In addition, the MSG drafted a legal text on the disclosure of beneficial owners. This text has been widely shared with stakeholders and addresses the issue of politically exposed persons for the first time. Pending the adoption of this law by the parliament, an online platform has been developed. This platform was officially launched on September 22 in the presence of several actors from the oil sector, mining, civil society, journalists and public administration, and allows systematic disclosure of beneficial owners. As per 10 January 2023, more than 20 companies registered in the platform, only 5 companies disclosed their beneficial owners.
In the meantime, and due to the lack of legal provision to disclose their beneficial owners, data on beneficial ownership are disclosed at the level of the EITI Reports. The 2019 EITI Report presents the result of the data collection from extractives companies and pointed that among the 29 companies included in the scope of the EITI Report, only 17 companies did submit their beneficial ownership declaration form, 8 of them submitted signed reporting templates. The report provides the information on legal owners.
Information seemed to have been requested only from the material companies holding an active permit and links to the market exchange for listed companies have been correctly provided. No MSG assessment or comments on the reliability and comprehensiveness of data collected was provided during this Validation. In its response to the draft Validation Report, the MSG noted that the independent study also included an assessment of data quality and completeness, acknowledging shortcomings in the comprehensiveness of the data collected due to a legal framework for the disclosure of BO data that remains constrained by the regulations governing the processing of personal data."
ac_ei_bo,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Benefical Ownership,Transparency of who owns and controls the country’s extractive industries,Americas,Dominican Republic,ac_ei_04,DOM,1,Partial,Partly met,"The Secretariat's assessment is that Requirement 2.5 is partly met. 
The objective of this requirement is to enable the public to know who ultimately 
owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive 
industries, particularly those identified by the MSG as high-risk, to help deter 
improper practices in the management of extractive resources. There is a strong legal and regulatory structure for the collection of BO information by the 
DGII and with the completion of the BO roadmap in 2019, the MSG has carried 
on efforts to overcome barriers to public disclosure of BO information, as noted 
in the MSG’s response to the draft assessment. The MSG also noted that there 
were efforts by the MSG to collect BO information from material companies in 
the scope of EITI reporting but that financial secrecy provisions prohibited the 
disclosure of this information in the 2020 EITI Report. Many civil society 
stakeholders consulted indicated that without public disclosure of this 
information, the objective of this requirement was far from being achieved.
Consulted government representatives noted that the upcoming 2021 EITI 
Report will include BO information from material companies, which represents 
some progress toward the public disclosure of this data.
The MSG has agreed upon a definition for beneficial ownership, including 
disclosure thresholds, and for politically exposed persons through Law 155-17 
and its accompanying regulations. There is a strong legal and regulatory 
framework for the collection of beneficial ownership information from all 
companies in the Dominican Republic, including from extractive companies. 
Mining industry representatives consulted confirmed that all foreign mining 
companies were required to form a domestic legal entity to bid on or apply for 
extractive licenses, which ensures that mining interests cannot be held by a 
foreign entity that is not subject to BO reporting requirements. However, this 
legal and regulatory framework does not extend to the public disclosure of this 
information in any form and efforts to collect BO data from all companies 
selected to report in this Validation cycle was stymied by financial secrecy 
provisions prohibiting the disclosure of this information. Meeting minutes from 
the Working Group on BO show that the MEM began drafting a resolution to 
require all mining companies to report BO information that would be included in 
the Mining Register hosted by DGM. Civil society stakeholders consulted 
considered the construction of a separate BO Mining Register to be an 
unnecessary compromise considering that DGII already holds this data. The 
2020 EITI Report notes that this resolution is still under revision. While a BO 
Roadmap is included for consideration in this Validation cycle, it appears to only
run through 2019. In its comments to the draft assessment, the MSG provided 
meeting minutes that indicated successful efforts to lift financial secrecy 
provisions to enable companies to disclose BO data, which is expected to take 
place in the upcoming 2021 EITI Report.
Given the lack of a MEM resolution and the fact that material companies did 
not disclose their BO information, there is no public accessibility of BO data in 
the Dominican Republic. BO data is not publicly available for extractive 
companies or for those bidding on or applying for mining, oil and gas projects. 
EITI reporting reflects the MSG's confirmation that all data points required 
under the 2019 EITI Standard are included in the DGII BO register but there is
no discussion or documented efforts to overcome barriers to public disclosure 
found in the DGII BO register. Information on legal ownership is publicly 
available in the Dominican Republic through the FEDOCAMARAS register, 
though individuals must specifically request this information from the 
FEDOCAMARAS register for each company of interest. Given that a company may operate under the jurisdiction of multiple Chambers of Commerce if the 
company has operations in different regions of the country, the practice of 
making individual requests could prove to be time-consuming and represent a 
barrier to access to information.
Civil society stakeholders consulted highlighted the presence of Dominican 
public officials as beneficial owners of mining companies in the Panama Papers
leak as a clear reason for the publication of BO information. While it is not 
against the law for public officials to hold interest in extractive projects or 
companies, civil society stakeholders were of the opinion that this information 
should be public knowledge. These representatives noted that while BO 
information can be found for multinational mining companies in the metallic 
mining sector, the same is not true for beneficial owners of non-metallic mining 
companies that also have large operations in the Dominican Republic. Mining 
industry representatives from large multinational companies indicated their 
willingness to supply BO information and to forego fiscal secrecy laws that 
prevent such disclosure. These stakeholders noted that direction needed to 
come from government to ensure proper disclosure of this information. Based 
on the comments made by the MSG in their response to the draft assessment 
and by government representatives consulted on the disclosure of BO 
information in the upcoming 2021 EITI Report, it appears that there has been 
positive progress since the previous Validation.

Consulted stakeholders considered that Ecuador had made some progress toward the objective of enabling the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in Ecuador’s extractive industries, especially through the Company Registry. The country has established a regulatory framework for collecting both legal and beneficial ownership information, with two main institutions responsible for this: the Ecuadorian Tax Administration (SRI) and the Superintendency of Companies (company registry). While the company registry discloses legal ownership, the beneficial ownership registry managed by SRI remains confidential and EITI reporting was not used as an alternative method to collect information on the natural persons, meaning that in practice there are no beneficial ownership disclosures in Ecuador. The MSG has not yet verified the accessibility, comprehensiveness, and reliability of the legal and beneficial ownership information reported by extractive companies to these entities. In both registers, there appear to be opportunities for improvement, such as tackling issues related to opaque ownership structures in the extractive sector, which are crucial to mitigate risks, such as those exposed by cases like Gunvor-EP Petroecuador and the more recent instance of shell companies exporting untaxed gold, where companies had fictitious addresses and minimal financial records. Consulted stakeholders highlighted the need for stronger government commitment. The Secretariat’s assessment is that Requirement 2.5 is partly fulfilled.  

EITI Ecuador has made some progress in initiating discussions on defining beneficial ownership (BO) and politically exposed persons (PEPs), as documented in meeting minutes (see here, here and here). Although the MSG has not yet agreed on a definition in line with the EITI Standard, existing legislation provides a foundation. Notably, the law on the internal tax regime and the 2021 Organic Law for Economic Development and Fiscal Sustainability mandate the establishment of a Beneficial Ownership Registry by the Ecuadorian Tax Administration (SRI). Recent SRI resolutions have broadened the scope of reporting entities, refining the definition of beneficial ownership to include other forms of control and establishing a threshold for non-tax residents with more than 10% participation (see here, here). The Tax Administration register requires to demonstrate the ownership chain and requires both legal persons and individuals who are beneficial owners of legal entities and structures to submit information. Additionally, SRI resolution 46/2022 and other laws indicate that access to beneficial ownership will be restricted to government entities, meaning this information is confidential, contradicting Ecuador's commitment to transparency under the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Action Plan. During the commentary phase, the MSG noted that the treatment of politically exposed persons is addressed across various monitoring systems. However, it remains unclear how information from these systems is integrated with beneficial ownership information collected by the SRI to unify data points in a singular repository.  

Ecuador EITI has not used its EITI reporting to provide a comprehensive description of the legal framework governing beneficial ownership data collection or to document actual disclosure practices. EITI reporting was not used to collect beneficial ownership information from extractive companies within the scope of reporting. The 2020 - 2022 EITI Report only refers readers towards information on legal shareholders, which is systematically disclosed by the company registry. This includes data points such as company name, type of entity/legal status, nationality, address, stock exchange, and percentage of shareholder ownership up to the natural persons. Ecuador’s MSG is yet to review if information on extractive companies disclosed through the company registry is comprehensive and reliable. During consultations, industry and civil society stakeholders acknowledged the value of this registry for tracing direct and past shareholders, including links across sectors and to foreign ownership. However, industry stakeholders highlighted areas for improvement particularly with regards to foreign entities (non-tax residents in Ecuador) that are not governed by domestic laws.  

With regards to beneficial ownership, there is potential for disclosure through the company registry, but stakeholders pointed out that the current disclosures do not consistently lead to identifying beneficial owners. Further, the company registry data collection framework does not fully align with Requirement 2.5 of the 2019 EITI Standard, as it lacks provisions for control mechanisms beyond shareholding and does not address ownership thresholds or reporting obligations for politically exposed persons (PEPs). The FATF Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) 2023 further highlights these limitations noting that the company registry does not cover control by other means (focusing on shareholders) and that the registry may not encompass all legal entities operating in the country (i.e. foundations, political parties and banks). In practice this means that the company’s registry capacity to comprehensively capture beneficial ownership for the extractive sector is limited. Development partners found the Ecuador 2020-2022 EITI Report helpful in identifying data sources for civil society. 

Consulted government stakeholders engaged in ownership data collection described ongoing inspections to the mining sector, which uncovered a growing number of registrations with the company registry. They also emphasised the need for increased collaboration with the mining SOE ENAMI EP to identify regulated and unregulated entities within the gold supply chain and the need for additional cross-checks and risk assessments for improved oversight. Collaboration with the Unit of Economic and Financial Analysis (UAFE) and participation in national and international assessments were mentioned as ongoing efforts to fulfil SCVS’s supervisory role. A new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law is also under consideration. Ecuador EITI should document these reforms.  

Ecuador’s legal framework for collecting beneficial ownership is in a constant state of flux. MSG should comprehensively document the government’s policies, laws, and planned reforms related to beneficial ownership with a particular focus on reporting obligations for corporate entities seeking or holding exploration or production licenses or contracts in the oil, gas and mining sector. The MSG must assess the quality and comprehensiveness of beneficial ownership data collected by the different government entities, identifying any material gaps or inconsistencies. EITI implementation offers a valuable platform to enhance beneficial ownership transparency. Civil society organizations and international organizations, such as the Open Government Partnership, Global Financial Integrity, and Open Ownership, have played an important role in pushing this agenda forward. Additionally, Ecuador is a signatory of the Opening Extractives program, although progress has been hindered by the changing legal framework and political instability, making efforts in this area more challenging.

Stakeholders had diverging views on the fulfilment of this objective. Beneficial ownership information is being collected by the authorities and can be accessed if legitimate interest is demonstrated. Legal ownership information is systematically disclosed. While the MSG has tasked the IA to review the plausibility of the BO data of reporting companies, and those findings were discussed, neither legal owners, nor beneficial owners, nor direct links to the stock exchange filings for listed companies of reporting companies were disclosed. While government and companies view the existing level of information as sufficient (‘fully met’), and argue that the CJEU ruling makes the generalised access invalid (government) or impractical (companies), civil society evaluated this provision as partly met. While information on the legal owners of companies is available for all companies covered by the commercial law, the information is not accessible for beneficial owners of all companies applying for, and holding, extractives licenses. Given the limitations of disclosures and the limited efforts from stakeholders on the MSG, the International Secretariat is of the view that the objective of the requirement to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries, is only partly fulfilled. 
In its comments to the draft assessment, the government reiterated that it was not possible to provide access to any beneficial owners given the CJEU ruling. The Secretariat notes that the anti-corruption objective of the requirement, to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries to help deter improper practices in the management of extractive resources was not considered sufficient legitimate interest to access material company entries. The Independent Administrator has received access to the register, but other stakeholders using the requirement’s objective do not. While the Secretariat recognises the legal constraints set by the ruling, the onus is on the MSG or government to demonstrate how and whether the overall objective of the requirement has been met despite the legal constraint. Given the above and in the absence of any disclosures of beneficial owners of material companies, this requirement remains only partly met.
The government codified the collection of beneficial owners as part of the transposition of the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering directive, which applies to all sectors, with the aim to avoid the use of the financial system for money laundering or finance of terrorism. The Law on the detection of profits from serious criminal offences (“EU-Geldwäscherichtlinie”) includes a definition in line with the EITI requirement. The declaration threshold is set at 25%. The definition of PEPs is stated in Art.3. On the availability of a list of PEPs, the government stated that a list is compiled by the Finance Ministry and sent to the European Commission, which is charged with its publication. To date, the European Commission has not yet published this list. It is unclear if there is a different threshold applied to the declaration of PEPs, or if only PEPs that hold 25% control in a company are required to report. 
All companies that are subject to the German Commercial Code (HBG) are obliged to report information on beneficial owners, hence the law in place includes companies applying for, or operating or holding interest in an extractives project. There is no reference in the legal framework that obliges mining authorities to check the beneficial owners of applicants, but stakeholders from the mining authorities noted that companies need to have a proof of registration in the commercial register to apply for a license, and that they have access to the transparency register. As per the current legislation in force guiding license allocations, the mining authorities are not obliged to review the beneficial owners of applicants. Stakeholders consider there is an enabling legal environment for the collection of beneficial ownership information.
There is currently no public register of beneficial owners of the corporate entity(ies) that apply for, operate or hold a participating interest in an exploration or production oil, gas or mining license or contract. The unrestricted access to the transparency register , which provided access upon proof of identity of the requester, was taken removed in November 2022, following the CJEU ruling, and replaced with a mechanism where registered users need to demonstrate a legitimate interest in the need to view this information for the purposes of fighting money laundering. The ruling stated that the full and indiscriminate access to beneficial owners of all companies, for the objective of combatting money laundering, was not compatible with the fundamental right of the protection of privacy. Government noted that in the case of companies with limited liability (“GmbH”), the information on beneficial owners (first name, last name, date of birth, town of residence and percentage shareholding) is de facto available where the shareholders field in the commercial register (“Liste der Gesellschafter”) are individuals (and not other companies). A guideline on how to access this information is not given in the EITI Report or on the reporting portal. The information on beneficial owners is not available for public limited company (PLCs, or “AG”) or hybrids of the legal forms the GmbH (limited liability company) and the Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) limited partnership companies (“GmbH&Co. AG”). Listed companies must provide voting rights notifications for changes above 2.5% cumulative ownership. The EITI Report or portal do not provide direct links to the stock exchange filings of reporting companies.
Further on access, for those individuals that were found to have legitimate interest, is a fee of EUR 1,65 applies per requested dataset. To request BOs, individuals and CSOs that can prove legitimate interest, need to provide proof of identity to the registry. The law allows beneficial owners to ask for their information to be restricted on the basis that the publication would have very harmful impacts, and the register publishes yearly statistics on the restrictions granted.  Government states that organisations and media that can demonstrate that they work on issues of anti-corruption would be granted access. 
Stakeholder consultations confirmed that all companies are requested to disclose beneficial owners. On the comprehensiveness of the information for all companies applying for, and holding licenses, the government could not provide an assurance of the comprehensiveness, as the government entity does not check the comprehensiveness of data of specific sectors. The MSG has tasked the IA with assessing and documenting gaps or weaknesses in disclosure of beneficial ownership information of reporting companies, including an assessment of the materiality of omissions and the reliability of beneficial information. Given that the reporting companies constitute the largest active companies in the oil, gas, mining and quarrying sector, this can be considered as a risk-based approach. The IA was found to have “legitimate interest” for the purpose of conducting this analysis on behalf of the EITI MSG. The MSG did not view the list of BOs and did not publish the beneficial owners of the reporting companies that it had tasked the IA to review. The IA’s conclusion was that the information provided in the register for the 18 reporting companies was comprehensive and plausible, as it corresponded to information on ownership which can be found through desk research. It is not known to the MSG if there are any PEPs among the beneficial owners. In its comments to the draft assessment, the government stated that there were no PEPs among the reporting companies. However, the Secretariat notes that there is no possibility of scrutiny of PEPs given there is no public BO data. During consultations, the government confirmed that mining authorities can view the information in the transparency register.
The assurances are defined by the anti-money laundering law and there is a running list of companies  that receive penalties for not complying with the request for publication. Stakeholders viewed that this mechanism was sufficient for enforcement of the reporting requirement, as it also provided an element of public accountability for those companies failing to fulfil their obligation. The MSG has not commented on the data verification method of the transparency register. 
Publicly listed companies that are reporting are listed in the transparency template, but without direct links to their stock exchange filings. The MSG has not considered how rigorous the requirement to the stock exchange are, which is an encouragement. The International Secretariat is not aware of the existence of joint ventures for any of the extractive’s projects.
Information on legal owners of companies operating in the extractive industry are obliged to fulfil the commercial register’s reporting requirements, including on legal owners. This information is available under the commercial register and can be found by searching the company name and the registration number, which are provided for material companies in the EITI Report. 
In its statement submitted for Validation,  the government maintains that the removal of public access to the transparency register was necessary to comply with the CJEU ruling and the protection of fundamental privacy rights and that the requirement on public access is fully met. In the statement the government argues that the transparency register remains online and accessible to members of the public, such as the Independent Administrator. In the statement the government argues that the transparency register remains online and accessible to members of the public, such as the Independent Administrator. The government further argues, that based on a legal commentary, the decision has a general binding and legal effect, which meant introducing the access barrier was necessary. The note further argues that the court judgement does not allow for a difference in weighing the fundamental rights according to the economic sector, such as the extractives sector. The note also concedes that there is a need to amend relevant regulations that are incompatible and that the concept of legitimate interest requires to be sufficiently concrete. 
It is the Secretariat’s understanding that the ruling is a narrow decision, invalidating in principle the generalised access to beneficial ownership information provided through the 2018 AMLD, but does not strictly forbid the public access to this information. The International Secretariat undertook the request to view entries in the register arguing with the underlying objective  of the requirement, but that rationale was not deemed sufficiently legitimate to access the data.  Based on the current levels of disclosures the International Secretariat concludes that the criteria of public access to beneficial owners for the public arguing with the rationale of the requirement is not yet met, and that there are further actions the MSG could undertake to improve access to existing information on ownership of reporting companies.
Upon request if the companies had been asked to waive their confidentiality, one government representative stated during consultations that a company publishing its beneficial owner would be unlawful, but another government representative stated that companies are allowed to make disclosures on their owners, as long as those agree, and the information is published on their own corporate website. Government highlighted that it was not possible to publish beneficial owners in EITI Reports, as the individuals could revoke at any time their consent to the publication of their identity. This could be addressed by publishing the data on beneficial owners as dataset on the transparency portal, as is done for the license register. Civil society criticised the lack of willingness on companies and government to provide information on beneficial owners through EITI reporting, for example through waivers.  They further criticised the lack of risk assessment by the MSG to identify what companies could be verified for their accuracy (besides the reporting companies). Civil society members stated that the MSG did not discuss the findings of the IA’s review. They stated that neither the government, nor companies were providing input on how to overcome the barriers for disclosure. They were further of the view that accessing legal ownership information, and information on shareholders, through systematic disclosure requires knowledge on what terms for the filings to look for, and that therefore at least the publicly available information on reporting companies should be available through EITI reporting.  In a statement submitted for Validation on beneficial ownership, companies noted that the request for permission to publish private information would be a large added task for the IA and present administrative burden for companies to fulfil.  In its comments to the draft report the government noted that the results were discussed and the findings were published on the website. The Secretariat notes that the description on the website does not give any information about the beneficial owners themselves, such as number of foreign nationals holding controlling interest.

The objective of this requirement is to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in Ghana's extractive industries to help deter improper practices in the management of extractive resources. The legal basis for the collection and publication of beneficial ownership information is in place. The accessibility of legal and beneficial ownership information for all companies applying for, and holding, licenses could not be confirmed Furthermore, the MSG’s analysis of the BO data collected by the Office of Registrar of Companies (ORC, previously called the Registrar General’s Department) suggested that the data is fairly reliable, but not comprehensive. Therefore, the objective of Requirement 2.5 is considered mostly fulfilled. Stakeholders have commended GHEITI’s support in advancing beneficial ownership disclosures, including capacity building. 
Ghana has established an enabling legal framework for the collection of beneficial ownership data. Ghana updated the Companies Act in 2019 to close gaps in reporting of beneficial owners (BO) and established thresholds to determine who is considered a beneficial owner of companies and defined what is considered to be politically exposed persons (PEP). According to consultations, BO and LO data is available to the public for a fee of USD 2 dollars. The MSG does not feel that this cost is prohibitive to public access to information and notes that the fees collected from this public access enable the functioning of the BO register that is managed by the Office of Registrar of Companies. The International Secretariat has attempted to access legal and beneficial ownership information based on the hyperlinks provided by the ORC and was not able to access this information in practice.  The MSG is invited to clarify the public accessibility of beneficial ownership data in its comments on the draft Validation report. 
On comprehensiveness, consulted stakeholders from government, civil society and international development partners all acknowledged that efforts were ongoing to collect BO data and that there was still a long way to go for full coverage of extractive companies. However, all constituencies expressed optimism at the pace at which BO data was being collected and that the ORC had a clear road map.Consulted ORC representatives noted that there are ongoing efforts to develop a bulk request feature that would enable the public to request BO data for several companies at once for a slightly higher fee. GHEITI has undertaken quality assurance studies on the comprehensiveness of BO data collected and deems that this information is fairly reliable. This determination was made based on comparing BO data available in ORC and in the UK Companies House and through cross-checking BO data found in ORC with personal identification data found in the National Identification Card Database, with assistance from Ghana Opening Extractives initiative. Consulted civil society members involved in this data verification process commended the ORC for including journalists and other CSO representatives in these efforts to both increase the capacity of investigative journalists and foster an inclusive space where CSOs and government could work together to improve BO verification practices. 
Nevertheless, there are still cases where material extractive companies reported legal owners in place of natural persons, which points to the continued need for capacity building efforts. Consulted government stakeholders agreed that further training efforts are needed and that these are underway. The Companies Act 2019 requires submission of BO information from all companies, not just extractive companies, and the 2020 GHEITI Reports provide an assessment of the portion of extractive companies that have submitted this data (20%) as of November 2022. In oil and gas, three out of six (50%) material companies had reported this data to ORC as of 2022 and in mining, seven out of fourteen (50%) reported this data as of 2022. Foreign companies operating in Ghana are not exempt and must report BO data to ORC. Given that all companies are required to submit BO data, this includes companies bidding and applying for extractive licenses. In practice, not all companies bidding and applying for extractive licenses have provided this information as at least one material company that participated in the bauxite/aluminium bid round has yet to provide BO data to ORC. Also partially incomplete is information regarding legal persons and stock exchange information for publicly listed companies, though this is only the case for one oil and gas company (legal persons) and one mining company (stock exchange information). Efforts appear to be ongoing to collect this information but at the time of the publication of the 2020 GHEITI Reports, this information remained incomplete. All criteria listed in the 2019 Standard (name of beneficial owner, nationality and country of residence, level of ownership and details about how ownership or control is exerted) other than identification of PEPs is requested, though some information remains incomplete for material companies listed in the 2020 GHEITI Reports. EITI reporting provides an assessment of gaps in submission of this information, and government and MSG plans documenting how to overcome identified challenges can be found in the Scoping report on Beneficial ownership transparency in Ghana that was jointly implemented by the EITI and Open Ownership and published in October 2023.
Other recommended aspects of the 2019 EITI Standard such as the MSG's consideration of how rigorous are requirements in the stock exchange filings of companies within the scope of disclosure are not addressed. "

Indonesia has made significant advances towards the objective of this requirement, which is to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries, since the previous Validation. The issue of beneficial ownership has been a significant focus of government policy. The groundwork for addressing beneficial ownership was laid out through strategic commitments in the National Strategy for Corruption Prevention 2021-2022 (Stranas PK), the Open Government Partnership National Action Plan 2020-2022 and the EITI beneficial ownership roadmap for 2016-2020. The issuance of Presidential Decree Number 13 of October 2018 mandates the disclosure of beneficial ownership information by all companies and entities registered in Indonesia. However, there are limitations regarding the collection of beneficial ownership information of foreign-owned companies, foreign natural persons, or non-residents.
The definition of a beneficial owner under this decree encompasses various forms of control and ownership, with a threshold set at more than 25% for share ownership, voting rights, or profit sharing. Additionally, it includes criteria related to decision-making, control, or benefit. Nominees or intermediaries are not explicitly prohibited from being named as beneficial owners, which might constitute a gap. Entities are required to disclose information such as full name, personal identity details, citizenship status, and the relationship between the corporation and the beneficial owner. However, there is no provision mandating the identification of politically exposed persons among beneficial owners. Implementing regulations do not appear to cover reporting obligations for publicly listed companies or state-owned enterprises. The MSG has not considered how rigorous are the requirements in the stock exchanges referred to and what ownership information is available from the stock exchange filings of the companies within the scope of the disclosures.
Compliance with beneficial ownership disclosure is mandatory for company registration, changes to company details, and license applications. The Regulation of the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Number 15 of 2019, outlines the procedures for reporting beneficial owners during company formation and mandates annual updates of this information. There are no provisions in the decree regarding information required of publicly listed companies or SOEs.
Efforts have been made to drive compliance, with approximately 40% of entities having submitted beneficial ownership data by the latest estimates from consultations with stakeholders. This is an increase from August 2022, when only around 29% (or 665,088 out of 2,269,790 entities) of companies that are required to do so had reported their beneficial owners, which was in turn up from around 8% in 2021. Sanctions for non-compliance primarily involve administrative measures such as blocking access to the central register or denying licenses. Effective compliance mechanisms include the MEMR’s refusal to issue a license to companies that have not submitted their BO information as part of the technical and financial criteria for applicants.
As of July 2022, beneficial ownership data has been made publicly accessible through the Directorate General of General Legal Administration AHU platform, although the comprehensiveness of this disclosure is not guaranteed. Notably, information on beneficial ownership of license applicants and bidders for mining, coal, oil and gas is collected comprehensively by the MEMR through their own beneficial ownership platform, but is not currently publicly disclosed. The MLHR has signed a memorandum of understanding with at least six ministries to exchange beneficial ownership data. The most effective cooperation to date has been with the MEMR, as an API between the two ministries’ portals ensures automatic exchange of beneficial ownership information.
The MSG has yet to thoroughly scrutinise the comprehensiveness of disclosures. Discrepancies between beneficial ownership data maintained by different government agencies have been noted, with MEMR having more comprehensive and up-to-date information compared to the MLHR. 
Indonesia has not yet developed a comprehensive verification system to assure the accuracy of the beneficial ownership information provided. The Presidential Decree of 2018 mandates the submitting company to verify its beneficial ownership by checking the validity of the information with their supporting documents. However, there are planned reforms to further regulate verification as, currently, the MLHR does not possess the mandate to verify the information. Efforts are underway to improve data reliability and accessibility, including the development of verification systems and standardisation of data schemas across government agencies. Consultations with stakeholders have confirmed that there is a planned regulation, to be passed by mid-year in 2024, to provide the MLHR the mandate to verify information.
Companies’ legal ownership data, which is maintained in a separate MLHR database from the beneficial ownership data, is available for a fee. To obtain this data for an Indonesia-registered company, users have to pay between IDR 50,000 and IDR 500,000 for access. Data on legal owners is currently available on a per-record basis, meaning that users can only download information on one company at a time, rather than being able to access the full dataset, which would allow for greater data use and analysis.
The most salient aspects highlighted in stakeholder consultations included the challenge of retrieving information from foreign owners, the lack of verification mechanisms to ensure robust collection of beneficial ownership data, and the lack of reporting of politically exposed persons, which was raised as one of the highest corruption risks with regards to ties to holding extractive licenses. 
The MSG’s comment on the draft Validation report recognises discrepancies in beneficial ownership data, noting that MEMR holds more comprehensive data due to its use in license applications. The use of beneficial ownership data to identify politically exposed persons has not yet been implemented. Additionally, the MSG mentions that revisions to the regulation are being drafted to include sanctions for non-compliance, aimed at improving corporate transparency."

None of the stakeholders consulted considered that the objective of public understanding of who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries had yet been fulfilled, although opinions varied about the level of progress achieved to date. Several government officials and the IA considered that Malawi was on the right path towards beneficial ownership transparency given that the draft beneficial ownership legislation that would cover all sectors was under development. However, several CSOs consulted considered that there were still significant efforts required to ensure beneficial ownership transparency, noting for instance that shareholder information for all extractive companies was not yet publicly accessible. 
Malawi has used its EITI reporting to formalise the government’s policy on beneficial ownership disclosures, expanding the scope of the government’s pro-disclosure policy to companies operating in all sectors of the economy in Malawi, although it has not yet established a legal and regulatory framework for beneficial ownership disclosures. The MSG’s submission for this Validation noted that progress on beneficial ownership disclosures had been slowed by resource constraints. Nonetheless, a definition of “beneficial owner” and “politically-exposed person” has been agreed. 
While beneficial ownership data has not yet been requested from all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses, Malawi has used its EITI disclosures to seek to collect data on the beneficial owners of companies included in the scope of EITI reporting. However, weaknesses in companies’ EITI reporting means that no beneficial ownership data has been publicly disclosed to date. While the MSG has agreed on quality assurances for ownership disclosures through the EITI, the assurances for mandatory reporting under the proposed legal reforms were still being finalised in 2022. Malawi has published a cursory review of the comprehensiveness of beneficial ownership disclosures by EITI reporting companies, but not of beneficial ownership data collection from other extractive companies beyond the scope of EITI reporting. 
Stakeholder consultations highlighted plans to establish a public beneficial ownership register as part of the Malawi Business Registration System maintained by the Registrar General, part of the Ministry of Justice. The Registrar General had started collecting some ownership data manually but was awaiting enactment of the beneficial ownership legislation to collect beneficial ownership data including name, occupation, residential address, and share of ownership or control. However, government officials noted that the draft legislation did not include disclosure requirements for politically exposed persons, although it was expected to set a 5% disclosure threshold in line with the threshold agreed by Malawi EITI. 
Malawi has publicly identified the stock exchange where some of the publicly listed extractive companies operating in the country are listed, although this does not appear to include all publicly listed companies, nor include guidance for accessing companies’ disclosures to their respective stock exchange regulators. Malawi does not maintain a publicly accessible company register providing information on legal owners, although Malawi has used its latest (2018-20) EITI Report to disclose the shareholders of seven of the 17 material companies included in the scope of reporting. 
In its comments on the draft assessment, the MWEITI MSG argues for an upgrade of a score, but notes that ensuring full beneficial ownership disclosure through EITI reporting was challenging due to the absence of enabling legislation. The comments highlight the importance of the development of the beneficial ownership regulations that are expected to be published soon. Given that several aspects of the initial criteria of Requirement 2.5 have not yet been addressed, including the establishment of an enabling legal framework and the request of beneficial ownership data from all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses, the Secretariat’s view is that the objective of the full set of criteria in Requirement 2.5 (which are assessed in Validations from January 2022 onwards) is not met.

Mexico's MSG has recently agreed upon a definition of beneficial ownership that includes thresholds for public disclosure. A legal definition of ‘politically exposed person’ is publicly available. There does not appear to be a legal or regulatory framework for the collection and disclosure of beneficial ownership information from extractive companies. While Mexico’s EITI reporting has not included requests for beneficial ownership data, it appears that such data was requested of companies bidding for oil and gas contracts, although the beneficial ownership information on companies bidding for recent oil and gas contracts does not appear to be publicly accessible. More broadly, there does not appear to have yet been an attempt to collect beneficial ownership data from all companies holding or applying for mining or hydrocarbons licenses and contracts since January 2020 in a consistent manner. There is no indication that the MSG has yet undertaken and published a review of the comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership disclosures to date. It appears unlikely that beneficial ownership information of all extractive companies will be consistently requested and disclosed from January 2022. Equally, information on legal ownership of extractive companies does not appear to be publicly accessible in Mexico."

Most consulted stakeholders considered that the objective of transparency in the ownership of all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses had been mostly fulfilled, although opinions were split over the level of progress towards that objective. Several government officials considered that the objective would be met once new legislation requiring the public disclosure of beneficial ownership of legal entities in all economic sectors was implemented in May 2022. However, several civil society representatives considered that there were still challenges associated with different definitions and thresholds for disclosures of beneficial ownership in different national laws, limits to the types of information to be disclosed and data reliability. 
The government has adopted a clear policy on beneficial ownership disclosure and enacted legal reforms to ensure the systematic collection of beneficial ownership information on legal entities in all sectors of activity, through the 2018 amendments to the Law on State Registration of Legal Entities. There are however four distinct definitions of the term beneficial owner in Mongolian legislation. The 2013 Law on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing, which is the basis for the 2018 Law on State Registration of Legal Entities, is closest to the definition in EITI Requirement 2.5 and is not sector specific. The other three definitions in the 2010 Banking Law, the 2019 General Law on Taxation (GLT) and the 2013 Law on the Securities Market all provide different definitions of beneficial owner based on specific economic activities. The term politically exposed person (PEP) is defined in Mongolian legislation requiring public officials to disclose their assets, but there is no process for identifying foreign PEP owners of Mongolian companies. There are also different disclosure thresholds in different laws, ranging from 33% in the AML law to 5-20% in the banking law and 30% in the GLT. EITI Mongolia has set a 5% threshold for its BO data collection and disclosures. The General Authority for State Registration (GASR) uses the AML law’s 33% threshold for disclosure. 
In practice, companies in all sectors, including in the extractive industries, have been requested to report their beneficial ownership to the GASR. All mining, oil and gas companies have also been requested to report their data through the EITI Mongolia eReporting platform, although the 2020 EITI Report notes that only 426 of the 2263 mining license-holding companies had done so as of December 2021. Public disclosures of beneficial ownership to date have been entirely by EITI Mongolia, which has built a register of beneficial owners of extractive companies from annual eReporting by companies. The NGO Transparency Foundation developed a standalone website for the EITI’s beneficial ownership data.  
The Law on Public Information enacted in October 2021 has come into force in May 2022, with provisions requiring the disclosure of beneficial ownership data. Some civil society stakeholders consulted expressed concern over the government’s discretionary powers to decide on what data would be made public, which was seen as more restrictive than under the 2011 Law of Mongolia on Information Transparency and Right to Information, which only exempted information on national security grounds. The same data gaps expected in the GASR beneficial ownership disclosures in May 2022 exist with regards to the current GASR register for legal ownership, where only the names of shareholders are provided, not their specific share of ownership. 
The EITI Mongolia has not commissioned a comprehensive review of beneficial ownership data collection and disclosures to date. However, the 2020 EITI Report includes a review of the 426 of the 2263 mining companies’ BO data, focusing on the comprehensiveness rather than the reliability of disclosures. However, a detailed study by the LTRC in September 2021 provides a review of both the legal framework and data collection to date, although consultations with government officials noted that some 60% of the 200,000 legal entities in Mongolia had reported as of March 2022. Thus, while several technical aspects remain outstanding regarding the detail and comprehensiveness of beneficial ownership disclosures, the Secretariat’s view is that the broader objective of enabling the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries is in the process of being fulfilled.

To date, beneficial ownership information has been requested from some, but not yet all, corporate entities that apply for or hold participating interests in mining, oil and gas exploration or production licenses. Following full enforcement of the UBO regulations in March 2022, it is expected that the requisite information will be available. However, this will need to be verified, including the coverage of legal ownership (available through other sources) and the coverage of politically exposed persons.

Opinions of stakeholders consulted were split over the level of progress in meeting the objective of enabling the public to know who ultimately owns and controls all companies operating in the country’s extractive industries. Many stakeholders consulted from all constituencies expressed pride at Nigeria launching Africa’s first EITI BO portal through NEITI in 2020. The early ownership disclosure work through NEITI had led the Bureau of Public Procurement to require beneficial ownership disclosure as part of its procurement process for government contracts. Several government officials considered that the objective was being fulfilled given the enactment of legal provisions requiring the public disclosure of beneficial ownership and that companies were in the process of complying with these obligations. While several stakeholders from all constituencies hailed the significant progress achieved to date, several CSOs and development partners consulted considered that data collection, the establishment of protocols for the automatic exchange of beneficial ownership data between different government agencies, and disclosures of beneficial ownership were still in progress. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report argue for an upgrade in the assessment of Requirement 2.5 to ‘fully met’ based on its view that the objective has been fulfilled. Indeed, the comments argue that Nigeria has established a robust legal and regulatory framework for beneficial ownership transparency and that it has built on its launch of Africa’s first public beneficial ownership register through the CAC’s launch of its own public beneficial ownership portal covering companies operating in all economic sectors. The Secretariat’s view is that the objective is mostly met, given enactment of an enabling legal framework but the need for further progress in publicly disclosing the beneficial ownership of all companies holding or applying for extractive rights. It is possible to identify the names of companies that have yet to disclose their beneficial ownership by cross-referencing the list of beneficial owners from the NEITI BO portal with the full list of companies holding participating interests in licenses and contracts in the mining and petroleum sectors.  

There is an enabling legal and regulatory environment for the collection and public disclosure of beneficial ownership information of companies operating in all economic sectors through the 2020 amendments to the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), which requires the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to establish a public beneficial ownership register. In the oil and gas sector specifically, the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) requires the new Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) to maintain a public register of beneficial ownership of active oil and gas licenses, leases and permits. The amended CAMA provides a definition of ‘beneficial owner’ aligned with Requirement 2.5.f.i and sets a disclosure threshold of 5% of ownership or control. Although the CAMA does not provide a definition or specific disclosure requirements for politically exposed persons (PEPs), the 2022 Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act provides a definition of PEPs. In addition, the 1990 Nigerian Code of Conduct and Tribunal Act requires senior government officials including politically exposed persons to disclose their assets and interests in companies. However, the lack of explicit provisions related to PEPs in the CAMA imply that PEPs are subject to the same 5% disclosure threshold as all other beneficial owners. The December 2022 regulation on “persons of significant control” include provisions for the disclosure of PEPs, albeit only for beneficial owners above the 5% threshold. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report highlight the importance of support from the Opening Extractives programme in increasing political commitment and stakeholder awareness of beneficial ownership transparency.  

The 2020 amendments to CAMA require that beneficial ownership information be requested from all Nigerian companies. In oil and gas, the 2021 PIA requires that beneficial ownership data be collected from companies holding oil and gas rights but does not specify whether such ownership data should also be collected from companies applying or bidding (even unsuccessfully) for oil and gas rights. However, the requirement to disclose beneficial ownership data to the II was included in the pre-qualification requirements for the 2023 mini-bid round, according to government officials consulted. However, the lack of public disclosure of the full list of bidders for each oil and gas license awarded through bid round hinders the ability to check whether the beneficial ownership of unsuccessful license applicants has yet been publicly disclosed. While all applicants for licenses registered in Nigeria are required to disclose their beneficial ownership to the CAC, foreign companies operating in Nigeria that are able to apply for oil and gas licenses are required to obtain an exemption from the requirement to register with the CAC from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. There were different opinions among stakeholders consulted over whether exempted foreign companies would nonetheless be required to report their beneficial ownership to the CAC. In mining, the 2020 NEITI Solid Minerals Report notes that the Mining Cadastre Office (MCO) has required disclosure of beneficial ownership as part of the license award, renewal and transfer processes since the enactment of new guidelines for applications for mineral titles in 2019. In consultations, industry representatives explained that NNPC had started collecting beneficial ownership data as part of its due diligence of crude oil buyers and third-party vendors and suppliers, and that it was hoping to publish this data on the (new) NNPC website in future.  

The IAs preparing NEITI Reports on both solid minerals and oil and gas have requested beneficial ownership information from material companies included in the scope of reconciliation since piloting this approach in the 2012 NEITI Reports published in 2014. Stakeholder consultations confirmed that directives had been sent by the NUPRC and the MCO to all oil and gas companies and all solid minerals companies respectively, requesting all license- and contract-holders to report their beneficial ownership to the respective regulators within seven days. While lauding the efforts to collect data, one development partner consulted expressed scepticism at the efficacy of setting such a short deadline for disclosing beneficial ownership data and considered that a longer timeframe would be required for all companies to report. Consultations confirmed that beneficial ownership data had been consistently requested from applicants for new mining, oil and gas licenses and contracts since 2022. A senior government official explained that while the PIA did not require beneficial ownership disclosures from applicants for oil and gas licenses that were not successful in their application for a license, the request for beneficial ownership disclosure had been incorporated into recent bid round pre-qualification procedures.  

The CAC and the NUPRC launched their public beneficial ownership registers in January 2023, although the NUPRC’s NOGABOR portal does not currently list any beneficial ownership data. The CAC portal lists the beneficial ownership (listed as ‘persons of significant control’) of companies incorporated since the start of 2022 but does not yet publish ownership data for most companies registered prior to the enactment of the 2020 CAMA amendments. The NEITI BO portal presents the most extensive beneficial ownership disclosures of extractives companies thus far, although this includes only partial ownership disclosures by those extractives companies that chose to report such information to NEITI. This is confirmed in a 2021 FATF assessment of Nigeria, which concluded that the CAC “does not maintain timely, adequate, accurate and up-to-date BO information”. While the CAC ownership portal has developed an API to push data to a planned 23 government agencies in due course (it has connected to a handful of agencies as of the time of this Validation), there is no automatic exchange of information between the three separate beneficial ownership portals operated by the CAC, NUPRC and NEITI respectively. This has resulted in distinct non-coordinated data collection efforts and three portals that have differing levels of ownership information on different companies.  

A fourth, non-public, register of beneficial owners is being developed by the Mining Cadastre Office, which has used beneficial ownership data collection since 2019 as a means of driving revenue growth (doubling revenues to NGN 4.3bn (around USD 9.8m) through the identification of mineral title holders seeking to avoid payment of outstanding debts by abandoning old licenses and applying for new licenses using newly formed companies, as noted in the 2022 Opening Extractives Policy Brief. However, the planned MCO’s beneficial ownership register does not appear to be integrated into the other BO registers.  

In December 2022, NEITI published a review of the comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership data disclosures to date. The review focused on the status of beneficial ownership disclosures for 2020, noting that a total of 254 extractive companies had reported their beneficial ownership information to NEITI. There are different estimates of the number of companies reporting their beneficial owners to NEITI, between 76 mining companies and 31 oil and gas companies listed in the 2020 NEITI Reports to estimates from development partners that a total of 199 extractive companies had reported their beneficial ownership to NEITI as of 2023. As of January 2023, a total of 303,700 companies in all economic sectors (out of a total of around 3.5m registered companies in Nigeria) have reported their beneficial ownership to the CAC, yielding information on a total of 628 beneficial owners of extractive companies reported to NEITI and the CAC combined. However, there appear to be instances of disclosure of legal owners as ‘beneficial owners’ in both the NEITI BO portal and the CAC portal. A government official explained that the CAC was following up with all companies registered prior to 2021 to collect data on their beneficial ownership, but that it had not yet set a timeline for enforcing sanctions against non-complying companies in line with the CAC’s PSC regulations of 2022. A development partner called for the CAC to start naming and shaming companies that did not report their beneficial ownership and ‘naming and faming’ those that did, particularly companies registered prior to 2021. The IAs for the 2020 NEITI Reports noted that they had not consulted with the CAC in preparing the reports. The IA explained that many companies listed on the CAC portal were marked as having no person of significant control, because the CAC was still awaiting this information. The NSWG’s comments on the draft Validation report emphasise that government entities have been implementing the beneficial ownership regulations by requesting ownership data from companies. They also note that Nigeria has advanced the implementation of ownership transparency through capacity building for stakeholders to use the ownership data in anti-corruption and sector reform efforts. The comments highlight evidence of civil society and media use of beneficial ownership data. The NSWG also argues that the gaps in availability of beneficial ownership of some companies will remain perpetually and therefore that the lack of beneficial ownership information on certain extractives companies should not be considered a gap in this Validation. The Secretariat recognises that efforts to ensure comprehensive disclosures of beneficial ownership data on extractives companies will involve a continuous process. Nonetheless, the Secretariat’s assessment that Requirement 2.5 remains mostly met is based on the relatively large number of companies holding or applying for extractive rights for whom beneficial ownership information has not yet been published. In addition, several of the companies for whom beneficial ownership data is not yet publicly available appear to be ‘high risk’.  

The NEITI Report appendices do not provide the name of stock exchanges where publicly listed extractive companies trade nor links to their statutory filings for all extractive companies, with only the 2020 NEITI Oil and Gas Report providing this information for some, but not all, subsidiaries of publicly listed companies. However, this information and more is required of state-owned companies and subsidiaries of publicly listed companies to be publicly disclosed in the PSC regulations enacted by the CAC in 2022. Information on legal ownership of mining, oil and gas companies is available through the CA’'s Company Register for a fee of NGN 1,000 (around USD 2.2) per corporate record. Government officials consulted explained that the CAC was currently digitising its corporate records, to enable the online portal to list legal owners of companies. There are discrepancies in the information on company legal ownership between the NEITI BO Register and the CAC Company Register.  "

While there has been progress in the building of the actual register, the register will not include information on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), and there is no significant improvement in terms of actual disclosures and public review of available information.   

Legislation establishing an ultimate beneficial ownership registry was enacted in March 2019, and came into force in June 2021, with the exception of chapters on submissions, verification, and fines. As assessed in the previous Validation on beneficial ownership, this definition of beneficial owners is aligned with the EITI Standard, and includes a clear ownership threshold of 25%, applicable to a broader group of business entities than required by the EITI Standard. Listed companies are exempt, and the stock exchanges where EITI reporting companies are listed are identified in the transparency template submitted by NOR-EITI as part of this Validation but are not disclosed elsewhere. 

Public access: The roll-out of the register is planned in three phases, beginning with the launch of the submission form and the register on 1 January 2023, and the collection of data through the government portal on which taxes and company registrations are managed (altinn.no). Phase two is expected to include an expansion of ownership forms, and follow up with businesses that have submitted, and after all companies are included in the register, the administration of fines for non-compliance. Phase three, expected to commence in January 2024, would link the Norwegian register to other European beneficial ownership registers. In its response to the draft Validation Report, the MPE stated that the delay in public disclosures were linked to the European Court of Justice ruling to the publication of BO data. The Government issued a statement that it is reviewing the public access of the register. In its response, the International Secretariat underlined that Norway is free to choose how to publish beneficial owners. While a public register is encouraged, it is not necessary to have such a register in place to satisfy this requirement. As of February 2023, there are no comprehensive disclosures of beneficial owners of all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses. 

Legal ownership data can currently be accessed in the national business registry (enhetsregisteret), by requesting information directly from companies,  and via the tax department’s website, whose shareholder register contains shareholder information for all limited liability companies registered in Norway or on the Oslo stock exchange. This information is updated annually and available on request at no cost. A desk review found this registry included all but three EITI reporting companies.   

Politically exposed persons (PEPs) will not be specifically designated in the register or systematically collected. Though information on PEPs is required for customer due diligence by the Act relating to Measures to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (the Anti-Money Laundering Act), consultations suggest that this is the responsibility of individual banks. In a letter dated September 2022 to oil and gas companies, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy requested companies who hold a licence or are prequalified, to publish on their website any persons who own or control the company that are PEPs. It is unclear if the companies have complied with that request. 

Verification of data: At the time of Validation, no data has been collected or verified. Consultations suggest that data entered via forms will be crosschecked against the population register and the company register (based on the ID numbers entered), and that mechanisms for addressing missing data in phase two have not yet been determined. There is no legal basis for verifying the accuracy of data, and consultations suggested no clear administrative plans to do so.  

The reliability and comprehensiveness of beneficial ownership information is quite limited. The transparency template submitted by NOR-EITI as part of this validation notes that privately held EITI reporting companies hold 15% of all oil and gas licences (213 of 1454). Legal ownership information is available for most of these, but not beneficial ownership information or information on PEPs. There is no designated body to review this data, or evidence of an assessment by NOR-EITI in keeping with Requirement 2.5(e).  "

The objective of the requirement is far from being fulfilled. 
Requirement 2.5 is intended to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries, and requires disclosures and actions according to two phases. As of 1 January 2022, the requirement is assessed in accordance with Phase 2 (see Validation Guide).
In regard to Phase 1, the MSG has agreed on an appropriate, publicly available definition of the term beneficial owner that is aligned with Requirement 2.5.f.i, as presented in the Beneficial Ownership Disclosure Report that was published December 2020 (page 53-54). This report also included a template form for requesting beneficial ownership information from companies, which was sent to all companies holding or applying for licenses, and which included all of the information required by the EITI Standard, including names, nationalities, countries of residences, and recommended information such as national identity numbers, dates of birth and means of contact. The BOD Report also identified several gaps, and implementation of the Report’s recommendations is included as an activity line in the PNGEITI work plans for 2021 and 2022, though no detailed activities are included. 
The content of the 2020 BOD report has not been matched by corresponding advances in government policy or practice. There is currently no government policy on beneficial ownership, and though definitions of beneficial owners have been proposed for inclusion in amendments to legal documents, the definitions included in the Income Tax Act amendment (9th draft) did not correspond with the definition required by the EITI 2019 Standard. 
Stakeholders consulted for this Validation consistently noted that PNG’s current regulatory framework is oriented towards shareholder information, and not beneficial ownership as understood in the EITI Standard. This also the case for the 2019 EITI Report, which discloses shareholder structure information of companies, not beneficial ownership.  Though work is underway for a new company registry, stakeholder expect that this too will be oriented towards information on company shareholders, in keeping with PNG law. Comprehensive information about the legal owners of extractive companies is currently not publicly available in PNG. It is not clear which extractive companies are publicly listed or wholly owned subsidiaries of publicly listed companies, although the BOD Report and the 2019 EITI Report map the ownership structure of some companies.
Though the disclosure form annexed to the 2020 Report had been shared with the IPA, no stakeholders consulted during this Validation were aware of any specific actions taken by the IPA towards using or adapting that form.  In regard to Phase 2, no steps or disclosures have been made. The MSG has not developed a specific strategy for addressing legal obstacles to beneficial ownership in PNG, or implementing the action plan and recommendations of the 2020 Report more generally. 
The MSG argued in its feedback on the draft Validation report that the requirement should be assessed as Mostly met. The MSG noted that legal reforms enabling BO disclosure will take time and that the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down follow-up on the BO study. It also noted that the MSG had established a technical working group to address beneficial ownership transparency and to follow up on the recommendations of the BO study. The Secretariat commends this forward-looking commitment. In light of available information and the Validation Guide, it continues to consider the requirement as Partly met."
ac_ei_bo,Anti-Corruption,Extractives,NA,EITI Validation Data,,Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),2025,2,Benefical Ownership,Transparency of who owns and controls the country’s extractive industries,Americas,Peru,ac_ei_04,PER,1,Partial,Partly met,"The International Secretariat’s  assessment is that Requirement 2.5 is partly met. The MSG’s ‘Transparency’ template considers that the objective of enabling the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries is not fulfilled. The Secretariat’s view concurs with the MSG’s self-assessment. While beneficial ownership data is collected by government agencies, there is no public access to this information and some consulted government stakeholders cast doubt on whether public accessibility was possible in the short to medium term.
Peru MSG does not use the 2021-2022 EITI Report to provide an overview of beneficial ownership work by the MSG to date. The latest EITI Report provides reference to the previous 2019-2020 EITI Report that outlines what were at the time, recent actions by government to improve the legal and regulatory framework for the collection of beneficial ownership data by government. The Secretariat commends the prior work done by Peru MSG and government officials around beneficial ownership transparency but laments the missed opportunity to use the 2021-2022 EITI Report to disclose this information for companies participating in EITI reporting.
Various norms have been passed in the last decade to strengthen Peru’s understanding and oversight of ultimate beneficial owners. The National Superintendency of Customs and Tax Administration (SUNAT) is charged with collecting beneficial ownership information from all companies, as beneficial ownership laws apply across all business sectors. These laws contain a definition of beneficial owner that includes a threshold (10%) for reporting as well as a definition for politically exposed persons (PEP) with penalties for late or absent reporting. Beneficial ownership laws do not extend to the public disclosure of this information. During consultations, the International Secretariat was informed by multiple government stakeholders that these beneficial ownership laws do not extend to foreign companies that hold extractive concessions, potentially pointing to an area for improvement. These stakeholders noted that while foreign companies that are awarded concessions are then required to form a domestic subsidiary, information sharing does not extend to reporting foreign beneficial ownership and PEP information. Instead, an affirmation from the company’s headquarters of the applicable anticorruption clause is deemed sufficient. 
The 2021-2022 EITI Report does not provide evidence of MSG discussion around beneficial ownership as a country priority or for those companies participating in EITI reporting. The Secretariat understands that many companies operating in Peru’s extractive sector are publicly listed, but the EITI Report does not provide an overview of where citizens can find respective stock exchange filings that could shed light on the ultimate owners of these companies. Consultations with the Independent Administrator revealed that beneficial ownership information was not requested from companies participating in the EITI reporting cycle. Legal ownership for participating companies is publicly available through Register of Legal Persons managed by the National Superintendence of Public Registries (SUNARP)."

While the 6th PH-EITI Report highlighted gaps in requirements for foreign companies to disclose their BO, a new SEC Memorandum Circular in 2020 effectively expanded BO disclosure requirements to foreign companies. While the SEC has started collecting BO data from all extractive companies, including foreign and companies applying for licenses, there are regulatory constraints hindering the publication of BO data given the lack of legal requirements to publish BO data and provisions of the Data Privacy Act. Information on legal owners of companies is available upon request from the SEC’s new platform (SEC Express) at a reasonable fee. Given confidentiality constraints, PH-EITI has worked with companies in the scope of EITI reporting to conclude waivers allowing for the publication of BO data. The 6th PH-EITI Report’s review of BO disclosures lists only 81 extractive companies that had been requested to report this data as of end 2020. The Philippines has established appropriate data quality assurances for BO disclosures. The MSG has published an assessment of the comprehensiveness and reliability of disclosures to date. Yet while information on the filings of companies publicly listed in the Philippines appears to be available online, the MSG does not appear to have published a comprehensive list of all extractive companies that are subsidiaries of companies publicly listed overseas, including references to their statutory filings at their respective stock exchange. Therefore, while the MSG has addressed most aspects of the initial criteria for the Validation of this requirement, there are key gaps related to the lack of an enabling legal environment for the disclosure of beneficial ownership information and the lack of systematic public disclosure of all extractive companies’ BO data given that disclosure consent forms were only requested from the 73 companies in the scope of EITI reporting in 2018."

The cost of information on legal owners and beneficial owners (XOF 2500 / EUR 4 per company) is not considered a constraint by stakeholders consulted.

The objective of enabling the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries is yet to be fulfilled. Beneficial ownership information was clearly requested only from material mining companies. Additional reporting under the Corporate Governance Code is limited and not accessible to the public. Partial information on beneficial and legal owners is disclosed in the 2019 EITI Report (Annexes 9 and 10). The legal framework includes definitions of beneficial owner and enables collecting data from license applicants. However, there is so far no legal obligation for all extractive companies to disclose their beneficial owners.  EITI reporting or other publicly available sources do not clearly indicate which extractive companies are publicly listed or wholly-owned subsidiaries of listed companies. The MSG argued in its feedback on the draft Validation report that requirement should be considered as mostly met, given efforts to collect BO data from material companies and to establish a legal basis for disclosures.
The MSG recently commissioned a study on beneficial ownership with the aim of understanding the state of play and developing an implementation roadmap. To date, registries of legal and beneficial ownership do not exist and a key recommendation from the recently published study was to reform the Companies Act 2009 and the Mines and Minerals Development Bill to explicitly mandate the Corporate Affairs Commission to maintain a publicly available ownership registry. Progress is currently ongoing to inculcate BO requirements. in both the Companies Act and the Mines and Minerals Development Bill There is a legal and regulatory framework for the collection of beneficial ownership information from mining companies applying for licenses through existing legislation, such as the Mineral and Mines Act 2009. Consulted stakeholders expressed that while the draft Mines and Minerals Development Bill would strengthen beneficial ownership collection and disclosure in the mining sector, further reforms to the Company’s Act are needed in order to extend these to the oil and gas sector and beyond the extractive sector. The Companies Act currently includes provisions for reporting of legal owners, as well as reporting of “beneficial interest”, when an individual’s ownership in a publicly listed company exceeds 10%.
It remains unclear from EITI disclosures whether beneficial ownership data has systematically been requested from all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses since January 2020. Stakeholders consulted indicated that this information has not been explicitly requested from all companies applying for or holding a license in the extractive sector. The Corporate Governance Code requires companies to report beneficial owners to CAC, or to explain why they are not reporting. Stakeholder consultations suggest that some extractive companies have reported BO information to CAC, but this data is not publicly accessible. The MSG noted in its feedback on the draft Validation report, that requesting data from all extractive companies would have been challenging without legal basis.
Sierra Leone's MSG has agreed upon a definition of beneficial ownership that includes thresholds for public disclosure. A legal definition of 'politically exposed person' is included in this definition and both are publicly available. Sierra Leone's EITI reporting indicates that beneficial ownership data has been requested from 14 companies deemed material in the 2019 EITI Report. Six companies reported BO data while legal ownership information is provided for by 11 of the 14 companies. Companies selected to report were requested to report all relevant data points listed in Requirement 2.5. The same quality assurances were requested as for other disclosures made by companies (see Requirement 4.9). There does not appear to be any mention about beneficial ownership information for applicants and bidders for extractive licenses.  A brief assessment of the comprehensiveness and reliability of the disclosures are provided for in Annex 11 of the 2019 EITI Report. A review of the disclosed BO information suggests that the ultimate beneficial owners of most major companies are captured.
There is no indication that the MSG has yet undertaken a review of the comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership disclosures by all extractive license-holders and applicants to date, although the 2019 EITI Report indicates which of the 14 material companies submitted BO data. There is currently no publicly accessible registry of beneficial and legal ownership for all companies operating in the extractives sector. Building on the SLEITI BO report that included practical recommendations, the MSG has set out specific activities in the 2022 work plan to address legal and practical barriers to comprehensive and quality disclosures. These include efforts to lobby key stakeholders to enact the Mines and Mineral Development Bill, map out strategies for implementation of the dedicated BO report, undertake a study on Phase 2 of BO Implementation and work with key agency to support launching of a public BO registry. A BO Technical Working Group has been established by the MSG to monitor and evaluate progress and report back to MSG and other key stakeholders on progress."

The objective of this requirement is to enable the public to know who ultimately owns and controls the companies operating in the country’s extractive industries, particularly those identified by the MSG as high-risk, to help deter improper practices in the management of extractive resources. Available disclosures, legal documents and stakeholder consultations suggest that this objective has yet to be fulfilled, although some aspects of the requirement have been addressed. 

Timor-Leste has made progress in establishing a legal framework for collecting, although not disclosing, beneficial ownership data. Gaps in disclosures have partly been addressed through EITI reporting. However, BO information has not been requested from all companies within the scope of Requirement 2.5. Disclosures by companies that were requested for BO data are partial. The MSG does not appear to have assessed the reliability or comprehensiveness of BO disclosures. 

In its comments on the draft assessment, the MSG noted that the majority of companies are subsidiaries of publicly listed companies and it was expected that the source and the information of the ownership was available. At the same time, the referenced 2020 Timor-Leste EITI Report includes several broken links that do not allow readers to confirm the availability of beneficial ownership information for publicly listed companies (pp.108-110). The MSG’s comments also highlighted that beneficial ownership information was requested for the 2020 Timor-Leste EITI Report, including full name, identification number, tax ID, date of birth, nationality, residential or service address, contact details and information on whether the beneficial owner is a PEP. However the MSG comments did not provide information on the outcomes of this exercise nor whether this data is comprehensively disclosed to the public. "

Stakeholders noted that Ukraine had for many years shown significant international leadership in promoting beneficial ownership transparency. However, stakeholders also acknowledged gaps in disclosure practices in 2022, creating an obstacle to the objective of advancing public understanding of who ultimately owns and controls companies in the extractive sector. Since then, efforts were underway to address these gaps and stakeholders seem confident in future resuming of disclosures. 
The EITI Report provides the government’s definition of beneficial ownership and an overview of laws, regulations and policies for recording and verifying beneficial ownership information. Beneficial ownership information is recorded in a public register known as the “Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Organisations” (or EDR) and is also disclosed on the EITI’s open data portal and in an annex of the EITI Report. The EITI Report describes legislative and regulatory changes introduced in 2022 and 2023, as well as planned reforms, which clarify various aspects of the country’s implementation of beneficial ownership requirements.
The legal framework creates an obligation to disclose beneficial ownership information as part of the registration of all legal entities. Companies must update this information whenever a change occurs. This information is captured in the EDR. A prerequisite for obtaining an extractive sector licence is the availability of beneficial ownership information in the EDR. 
The information disclosed in the EDR mostly meets EITI requirements. However, it does not include information to identify politically exposed persons (PEPs). This information was previously available through non-governmental sources, notably the Open Register of National Public Figures of Ukraine. However, access to this register was closed in 2022 due to martial law. More recently, EITI reporting forms have sought to collect information on PEPs and the EITI’s open data portal captures this, though it only relates to reporting companies, and not all companies owning or applying for a license. Beneficial owners of all companies owning or applying for a license are available through the national auction website, but do not include PEPs or non-resident information.
A further gap in fully meeting the requirement relates to the disclosure of beneficial ownership information for non-residents, which historically has not been captured in the EDR. In 2022 only one license was issued to a non-resident. As a result, the effect of this gap on public understanding of beneficial ownership in the sector was limited. The government introduced regulatory changes in 2022 and 2023 to address this challenge though these were not yet in effect within the reporting period for this Validation. In more recent reporting periods, the EITI provided this information for reporting companies, which demonstrates disclosure progress. In the 2023 EITI Report published in January 2025, information on beneficial owners was requested from all reporting companies, including non-residents.
The EITI Report notes that beneficial ownership disclosures can be incomplete or inaccurate. In some cases, the Independent Administrator identified discrepancies between the information available in the EDR and data disclosed through the EITI. These discrepancies are highlighted in an annex to the EITI Report. The EITI MSG discussed the discrepancies, including the explanations provided by companies, and resolved to evaluate mechanisms to guarantee the reliability of beneficial ownership information. More recently, procedures have been put in place to penalise companies for the submission of inaccurate beneficial ownership data.  
Stakeholders remarked that Ukraine had previously been a global leader in efforts to ensure public access to beneficial ownership data. Stakeholders also noted that beneficial ownership data had been useful in identifying ownership structures that could compromise national security or violate sanctions. While access restrictions due to martial law represented a setback for beneficial ownership transparency, stakeholders were of the view that the current approach struck an appropriate balance between protecting national security interests and promoting public access to data. There is also evidence the government has used BO data in anti-corruption cases  Stakeholders expected a return to strong commitments to beneficial ownership transparency once martial law ends."

Beneficial ownership information is collected and made publicly available by Companies House for entities that hold and apply for licenses in the extractives industry. Quality assurances are in place and publicly documented, while the Companies House beneficial ownership registry covers all extractives companies.

UKEITI reporting has highlighted publicly listed companies and identified the stock exchanges where they are listed and has disclosed specific links to relevant companies’ stock exchange filings in accordance with Requirement 2.5.f.iii as part of the 2020 Payments Report published after the start of Validation."

While most aspects of Phase I of beneficial ownership requirements have been addressed, there is no evidence that the ZEC has published an assessment of the comprehensiveness and reliability of beneficial ownership disclosures to date from all companies holding or applying for extractive licenses (i.e. not only of material companies included in the scope of EITI reporting in accordance with EITI Requirement 2.5.c). In its comments to the draft version of this assessment, ZEC indicated that most technical aspects of the requirement are addressed, though also confirmed that some gaps and challenges exist. In addition, the PACRA's company register and portal does not provide the name of the stock exchange where publicly-listed companies (or their wholly-owned subsidiaries) are listed. Lastly, legal ownership of extractive companies is only partially disclosed by Zambia EITI, and while the PACRA registry contains some information on legal owners, for most companies it is not possible to ascertain that all legal owners and their respective shares have been disclosed. BO data is not available through the PACRA register for the material companies."
